            "introduction": "Mumps virus is a single-stranded negative sense RNA virus, belonging to the genus Rubulavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. The mumps virus genome encodes seven major proteins in the following gene order: nucleocapsid (N), phospho (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), small hydrophobic (SH), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), and large (L) protein genes 1. V and I proteins are also produced from the P gene. There are two envelope glycoproteins, F and HN. The HN protein is involved in the virus attachment to sialic acid receptors on the surface of host cells. This leads to a conformational change of HN which induces further conformational change of the F protein in the cascade reaction of cell fusion 1, 2. Thus, mumps virus infection is initiated by the F and HN proteins, and neutralizing epitopes are located on these proteins 3, 4.An acute infection of mumps virus is characterized by self-limiting demonstrable swelling of the parotid glands with tenderness and several complications have been reported following parotitis, including aseptic meningitis, deafness, orchitis, and pancreatitis 1, 5. Mumps virus circulates throughout the world, and genotype classification of the wild type is useful for identifying the pathway of transmission 6. Recently, circulating mumps virus strains have been divided into 12 genotypes from A to N (excluding E and M) based upon the sequence diversity of the SH gene 7, 8. Currently circulating strains in Japan were divided into four genotypes, B, G, J, and L 9.The isolation of mumps virus is essential for the diagnosis of patients and for monitoring the antigenicity of wild circulating strains. The efficiency of virus isolation depends mainly upon the infectious viral load in clinical samples and the sensitivity of the cells used for isolation. Vero cells have been used, but isolation is not always successful because of the low viral load, timing of sample taking, and transportation. Several serological tests have been employed for the diagnosis of mumps virus infections and, among them, the enzyme-linked immuno-assay (EIA) was used to detect IgM antibodies for diagnosis and IgG EIA to investigate immune status 10, 11. EIA antibodies did not reflect protective immunity and a neutralization test is the most sensitive way to predict protective immunity 12, 13. Neutralization tests take a long time to obtain results and involve several complicated procedures 14, 15. The sensitivity of neutralization test was enhanced when complement was added 15. Recently, the addition of complement was found to lead to deposition on the surface of viral particles bound with antibodies and destroyed the structure of mumps virus during the neutralization reaction 16. Thus, the presence of complement seems to be essential for neutralization testing against mumps virus. In this study, a recombinant mumps virus expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was generated and the requirement for complement was examined using fresh and stocked sera."

            "introduction": "The major targets of HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection are CD4 T cells 1. During the acute stage of infection large numbers of resting and memory CD4 T cells disappear from the lymphoid tissues and mucosal layers, particularly in the gut, by direct infection and by bystander effects. Lymphoid tissue remains the primary site of infection after acute infection has resolved and the viral load approaches a steady state called the “set-point” 1. Chronic infection is characterized by a set-point viral load, and rapid turnover of productively infected cells 2–4. To maintain this steady state requires a balance between virus production and clearance, and between target cell production and death. Combining image analysis with in situ hybridization in lymphoid tissue from patients chronically infected with HIV-1, the total number of productively infected CD4 T cells has been estimated to be  cells, and the total number of HIV-1 particles has been estimated to exceed  virions 5, 6. At steady state, one could naively conclude that a single productively infected CD4 T cell should therefore account for a viral load of approximately 500 virions. We shall show below that the situation is more complex.To understand viral production and clearance better, one needs to consider the current quantitaive estimates of viral production and clearance, as well as where these processes are occurring in the body. Most of the total body virus is located in lymphoid tissues, typically in association with follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) 1, 5. FDCs trap virus and retain it on their surface for many months 7–11. The FDC associated virus pool fills up during early infection, i.e., not later than a few days after onset of symptoms, and does not expand over the course of chronic HIV-1 infection 12. Although most of the virus resides in this fairly constant storage on FDCs, the store rapidly declines during antiretroviral treatment (ARV) 13, suggesting the existence of a quasi steady state between free and FDC associated virus in the lymphoid tissue 8–10, 14. In a mouse model it was shown that a small fraction of HIV-1 persisted on FDCs, and remained infectious over a period of 9 months 7. A recent study confirmed the long-lived nature of this reservoir in humans 11.Viral clearance rates have been estimated in the blood, and different techniques have yielded a variety of estimates 4, 15–17. Rapid clearance rates with half-lives of 3–4 minutes were found after infusion of SIV into the blood of uninfected and infected rhesus macaques 16, 17. In patients chronically infected with HIV-1, more than 10-fold slower clearance rates were found using plasma apheresis to increase viral clearance, and hence perturb the viral set point 15. By plasma apheresis approximately  particles were removed over a period of two hours, and this reduced the viral load in blood, with a nadir that was approximately half of the original viral load 15. The mere fact that the removal of less than 1% of the total body virus lead to an observable decline in the plasma virus load 15, suggests that the exchange of virus between the lymphoid tissues and the blood cannot be rapid 14. Further, sequence analysis of virus in splenic white pulps suggests that virus trapped on FDC is produced locally 18, supporting the notion of slow viral exchange between blood and lymphoid tissue.Virus production rates have also been estimated by several techniques. Because in other lentivirus infections, most notably visna virus, intracellular viral DNA levels increase approximately exponentially and then virus appears to be released rapidly 19, the term burst size is commonly used to describe the total amount of virus produced by an infected cell 20. If one knows the burst size, , and the average lifespan of a productively infected cell, , then the viral production rate, , is given by . Note that  is then the average rate of virion production over the lifespan of a productively infected cell. Current estimates suggest  d 21. Thus, the burst size corresponds to the daily viral production rate.Recent studies have combined image analysis with in situ hybridization to estimate burst size. Assuming that the maximal HIV RNA count in a cell corresponds to the burst size, Haase et al. 5 estimated a production rate of approximately a hundred particles over the life span of a productively infected cell. Hockett et al. 22 quantified more precisely the amount of viral RNA (vRNA) per cell by a PCR technique. They found an average of 3900 (range 3162–5011) vRNA copies per infected cell, and because of limited variation in the number of copies per cell, they concluded that viral production is a few thousand virions per cell, and also assumed that bursting was an all-or-none phenomenon 22. However, the estimates by Haase et al. 5 and Hockett et al. 22 are based on measuring HIV RNA at a single time point. If infected cells continue to produce virus over an extended period, then these estimates would be underestimates of the true total cellular production of virus.One can also attempt to measure burst size by directly imaging the extracellular viral particles surrounding an infected cell 23. Using this method, Reilly et al. 23 found  and  copies of HIV-1 RNA surrounding infected activated and resting CD4 T cells, respectively, in the lymphoid tissue of acutely SIV-infected rhesus macaques. They then fitted a five parameter model to this data, with three of the parameters describing the rate of viral production as a function of time since infection (see Methods), and the remaining parameters describing the rate of exponential decay of cells producing virus, and the rate of loss of viral particles. Using this model, they estimated that the half-life of virus located around CD4 T cells producing virus in lymphoid tissue was approximately three hours. However, this half-life combined diffusion of virus out of the local area and true virion clearance 23. Even if all loss was due to clearance, a three hour half-life corresponds to a per virion clearance rate of  d. With this estimate, Reilly et al. 23 calculated median production rates of approximately 1500 and 1400 viral particles per activated cell, and of approximately 650 and 3400 viral particles per resting cell, depending on two different assumptions for the half life of productively infected resting cells (see Methods).Finally, the most direct estimates for the total amount of virus produced per infected cell was achieved using single-cycle SIV to infect PBMC which were placed back in uninfected rhesus macaques. By measuring the total amount of virus produced and accounting for clearance, this experiment yielded a total production of approximately  (range –) virions per infected cell 24. Because productively infected cells have a lifespan of about one day, the cellular burst size estimates of Chen et al. 24 imply daily production rates of approximately  virions.Summarizing, the latest production rate estimates converge on a few thousand to approximately  virions per productively infected cell 22–24. The production rate estimates of Reilly et al. and Chen et al. depend on the viral clearance rate, . The 10-fold range in the estimated production rates is at least partly due to differences in the clearance rate used in the calculations. Reilly et al. 23 estimate that  d in lymphoid tissue, while Chen et al. 24 used a previous estimate of  d in the blood 15. Since, our main result will be that the clearance of free virus in lymphoid tissue should be fast, and that the observed clearance from the blood is not clearance but the rate of efflux to other organs, we will vary the production rate in our analysis and consider  to  particles per cell as potential realistic estimates. Finally, note that different cell types, e.g., infected macrophages, may have different production rates than infected T cells. Here we consider that the vast majority of virus is produced by infected CD4+ T-cells 4, 25, and hence use estimates of production from those cells.In one earlier modeling study a production rate of several thousand particles per cell was shown to be consistent with a viral half-life of 3–4 hours in the lymphoid tissue 14, suggesting that the recent estimates of 10-fold higher production rates 24 imply even shorter half-lives. However, large total viral production per infected cell 22–24 and the short viral half-lives they imply 14, seem difficult to reconcile with the suggestion that most of the virus in the lymphoid tissue is long-lived and in association with FDCs 5. The problem of balancing production with clearance can be introduced by a simple calculation that assumes the body is a single well-mixed compartment. An order of magnitude estimate for the total number of productively infected cells in a human is  cells 5, 6. For a human with a viral load of approximately  particles ml of plasma, and an estimated total of 15 liters of extracellular body water in which virus could distribute, one estimates that there are a total of  free virus particles in extracellular fluids (i.e., only about 2% of the estimated total body load) 4. Requiring steady state in the conventional model for virus production, i.e., , with a production rate of  viral particles per infected cell, , per day, and a steady state of  free virus particles and  productively infected cells, one would need a per virion clearance rate of  d, which is much higher than published estimates for the viral clearance rate in humans 15, but resembles the rapid clearance rate observed in rhesus monkeys 17. Even if  d then  d is needed to balance production, which is still larger than the current clearance rate estimate in humans 15.In this paper we attempt to reconcile the various estimates for the viral clearance rate, the viral production rate, and the amount of long-lived virus trapped on FDCs within one modeling framework in order to test whether there is a consistent interpretation explaining all observations. To do so we introduce compartmental models to analyze recent experimental data on viral clearance in various organs, and estimate the rates at which virus is exchanged between them."

            "introduction": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are vertebrate pathogens that cause severe diseases in a wide range of animals and infections in humans that until recently were limited to common colds 1. Nevertheless, by the end of 2002, a novel coronavirus causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) emerged in China and rapidly spread worldwide causing around 8000 infections leading to death in 10% of the cases 2, 3. Since then, CoVs surveillance programs were intensified, and two additional human coronaviruses, already circulating in the human population, were identified as the causative agents of several cases of pneumonia and bronchiolitis (HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63) 4. Furthermore, in 2012 a novel coronavirus infecting humans, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) appeared in Saudi Arabia and disseminated to nine additional countries 5, 6. To date, 182 cases of MERS-CoV have been reported, which has led to 79 fatalities (http://www.who.int). Clinical presentation of infected individuals involves acute pneumonia, sometimes accompanied by renal disease 7. CoVs similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have also been isolated from bats widely distributed throughout the world 8–13, which represents a potential reservoir for outbreaks of novel zoonoses into humans. Therefore, understanding the virulence mechanisms of these pathogens, will allow the development of effective therapies in order to prevent and control future outbreaks.SARS-CoV is an enveloped virus containing a positive sense RNA genome of 29.7 kb, one of the largest viral RNA genomes known. The genome encodes a viral replicase involved in the synthesis of new genomes and in the generation of a nested set of subgenomic messenger RNAs, encoding both structural proteins present in all CoVs: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleoprotein (N), and a group of proteins specific for SARS-CoV: 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b 14.SARS-CoV E protein is a 76-amino acid transmembrane protein actively synthesized during viral infection, that mainly localizes at the ERGIC region of the cell, where virus budding and morphogenesis take place 15–18. Different requirements of E protein during the virus cycle have been described among CoVs. Elimination of E gene in transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) or MERS-CoV leads to a replication-competent propagation-deficient phenotype 19–21. In contrast, deletion of E gene from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) or SARS-CoV does not abolish virus production, although viral titers are significantly reduced by 1000 to 20-fold, respectively 16, 22. Interestingly, E gene deleted SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-ΔE) was attenuated in three animal models, and confers protection against challenge with parental virus in immunized hamsters, and in young or aged mice, representing a promising vaccine candidate 16, 23–27. Cells infected with SARS-CoV-ΔE show increased stress and apoptotic markers compared to wild type virus, perhaps resulting in a decreased productivity of infection 28. Additionally, elimination of the E gene diminishes inflammation induced by SARS-CoV through the NF-κB pathway 27.Remarkably, SARS-CoV E protein was found to self-interact forming a pentameric structure that delimits an ion conductive pore, which may play a role in virus-host interaction 29–32. E protein ion conductivity was also confirmed for a set of CoVs from different genera 33. The ion channel (IC) activity of SARS-CoV E protein was mapped within the transmembrane domain of the protein by using synthetic peptides 31, 34, 35. Recent studies determined that both ion conductance and selectivity of E protein ion channel were highly controlled by the charge of the lipid membranes in which the pores were assembled. This suggests that lipid head-groups are components of the channel structure facing the lumen of the pore, a novel concept for CoV E protein ion channel 34, 36. Chemically synthesized SARS-CoV E protein showed slight preference for cations over anions when reconstituted in lipids that mimicked both charge and composition of ERGIC membranes, and displayed no specific selectivity for a particular cation 34, 36. In addition, point mutations that suppressed SARS-CoV E protein IC activity (N15A and V25F) have been identified and confirmed 34, 35.Several reports have analyzed the relevance of CoV E protein transmembrane domain, which contains ion-conduction properties, in virus maturation and production. Insertion of alanine residues within the transmembrane domain of MHV E protein rendered crippled viruses that evolutionary reverted to restore a proper structure of the alpha helix within the transmembrane domain 37. Interchanging the genus β CoV MHV E protein transmembrane domain by those of CoVs from different genera revealed that only domains belonging to genus β, and γ, but not α, functionally replaced MHV E transmembrane domain in terms of viral production. It was speculated that this effect was a consequence of the possible different ion selectivity of these domains 38. Replacement of genus γ CoV infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) E protein transmembrane domain, which displays IC activity, for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein transmembrane domain lacking this function, interfered with an efficient trafficking and release of the viral progeny in the infected cells 39. In contrast, mutation of threonine at position 16 to alanine, which is the amino acid change predicted to inhibit IC activity in IBV E protein did not affect virus-like particles formation, suggesting a multifunctional role of E protein 40.Besides the E protein, SARS-CoV encodes two other ion-conducting proteins, 3a and 8a 41, 42. In a related virus, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), novel IC activity has been described within the 4a protein 43. The abundance and conservation of IC activity suggests an importance of influencing ion homeostasis within cells during the CoV infection cycle.Modulation of the cellular ion balance seems to be a common issue for viruses, as a growing list of viroporins are being identified, especially within RNA viruses 44. Highly pathogenic human viruses such as influenza A virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and several picornaviruses, among others, encode at least one viroporin 45–49. Viroporins have been involved in virus entry, trafficking, morphogenesis, maturation and even virulence 50–53. Influenza virus M2 is essential for viral RNA release from infections virions within the endosome into the cell cytoplasm 45 and also for raising the pH at the trans-Golgi network lumen, which prevents premature activation of hemaglutinin, which may render non-infectious virions 54. Similarly, HCV p7 protein equilibrates the pH at the Golgi apparatus, protecting acid-sensitive intracellular virions 51. Coxsackievirus 2B protein alters Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ and H+ concentrations, which in turn delay protein transport through the secretory pathway facilitating virus assembly and preventing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules from reaching the cell surface 48, 55, 56. A recent finding described that influenza M2 protein IC activity triggers NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation 52. Furthermore, mutant versions of M2 protein that conduct Na+ and K+ ions apart from H+ ions more strongly elicited the inflammasome response 52. This novel mechanism of immune system activation has also been proven for other viroporins 53, 57–59.Viral proteins with IC activity impact different aspects of the virus life cycle, however, the involvement of their IC activity in pathogenesis remain to be further explored. Previous findings demonstrated that SARS-CoV E protein is a virulence determinant. In this manuscript we analyze the contribution of E protein IC activity in pathogenesis. Two recombinant viruses, each one containing a single point mutation suppressing IC activity, were generated by reverse genetics. Mutant viruses showed a tendency to evolve and restore E protein IC architecture and activity after serial infections, and viruses with deficient IC activity were outcompeted by those displaying this function after co-infections. This highlights the importance of IC activity in virus fitness. Interestingly, infection of mice with a set of viruses lacking or displaying E protein IC activity, revealed that the activation of inflammasome pathway, and the exacerbated inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV was decreased in infections by on channel deficient viruses. In addition, less lung damage and proper localization of Na+/K+ ATPase within epithelia, which prevents edema accumulation, was detected for the mice infected with the viruses lacking E protein IC activity. As a consequence, increased survival of the infected animals was observed when E protein ion conductivity was absent. Therefore, E protein IC activity is required for inflammasome activation and a novel determinant for the virulence of highly pathogenic SARS-CoV."

            "introduction": "Over the past two decades, technological advances in molecular biology have fuelled progress in the discovery of new pathogens associated with human diseases. The identification of novel viruses such as hepatitis C virus (Choo et al. 1989), sin nombre virus (Nichol et al. 1993), and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (Chang et al. 1994) has relied upon a diverse range of modern molecular methods such as immunoscreening of cDNA libraries, degenerate PCR, and representational difference analysis, respectively. In spite of these successes, there remain numerous syndromes with suspected infectious etiologies that continue to escape identification efforts, in part due to limitations of existing methodologies for viral discovery (Muerhoff et al. 1997; Kellam 1998). These limitations, coupled with the constant threat posed by newly emerging infectious diseases of unknown origin, necessitate that new approaches be developed to augment the repertoire of available tools for pathogen discovery.We have previously described a prototype DNA microarray designed for highly parallel viral detection with the potential to detect novel members of known viral families (Wang et al. 2002). This microarray contained approximately 1600 oligonucleotides representing 140 viruses. Building upon this foundation, a more comprehensive second-generation DNA microarray consisting of 70mer oligonucleotides derived from every fully sequenced reference viral genome in GenBank (as of August 15, 2002) was constructed. The most highly conserved 70mers from each virus were selected as described by Wang et al. (2002) to maximize the probability of detecting unknown and unsequenced members of existing families by cross-hybridization to these array elements. On average, ten 70mers were selected for each virus, totaling approximately 10,000 oligonucleotides from approximately 1,000 viruses. The objective was to create a microarray with the capability of detecting the widest possible range of both known and unknown viruses. This pan-viral microarray was used as part of the global effort to identify a novel virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in March 2003, as reported by Ksiazek et al. (2003). We describe here the experimental details of the microarray methodology for novel virus identification, using the SARS outbreak as an example."

            "introduction": "There have been several human pandemics caused by influenza A viruses over the last 150 years 1, 2, 3. The first pandemic of the 20th century, the “Spanish” influenza (H1N1) pandemic of 1918–1919, was particularly lethal in young, otherwise healthy adults, killing an estimated 40–50 million people worldwide 2, 4, 5, 6. Genetic analyses of specimens collected from victims preserved in the arctic and archived tissues from World War I soldiers suggests that the 1918 H1N1 strain was an avian-origin virus that adapted to humans 7. The “Asian” influenza pandemic (H2N2) in 1957 and the “Hong Kong” influenza pandemic (H3N2) in 1968 were less lethal and resulted from avian-human virus reassortment 4, 5. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus is a reassortant of human, swine and avian-origin influenza virus gene segments, with the HA gene sharing a common ancestry with the 1918 pandemic virus HA that has been circulating in swine populations globally 8. Since its emergence in the spring of 2009, the pandemic H1N1 virus quickly became the predominant strain globally9.The isolation of a highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus, subtype H5N1 (referred to as H5N1 in this manuscript), from a 3-year-old boy in Hong Kong in 1997 was the first detection of this virus strain in humans and raised concerns worldwide of the potential for a pandemic of avian origin with a lethality in the range of the 1918 pandemic 10. As with the 1918 virus, all of the genes found in the H5N1 viral strain in Hong Kong originated from avian viruses, 4, 10. While H5N1 has not yet demonstrated the ability to transmit efficiently from person to person, the high case-fatality associated with infection, and because of the immense potential for influenza viruses to mutate and adapt to other hosts, H5N1 remains a continuing public health concern.As of 8 June 2010, 15 countries have reported a total of 499 confirmed cases of human H5N1 infection to WHO 11. By far, the largest numbers of human cases has been reported from Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt, each having reported more than 100 cases (these three countries account for 79% of all human cases). No human cases have yet been reported in Western Europe or the Americas, although H5N1 has been detected in poultry in Europe. The number of reported cases and fatalities, case fatality rate (CFR), H5N1 virus clades identified that have infected humans, and the median age and gender (% male) of reported cases 12, 13 vary by country (Table 1). The crude CFR for all cases to date is high (CFR = 59.1%, interquartile range 32.5–77.8), but also varies substantially among the 15 countries.10.1371/journal.pone.0014582.t001Table 1\n

spill-over into the human population and other species. The predominant modes of transmission from poultry to humans remain incompletely understood and limited exposure information from infected persons has restricted our ability to evaluate risk factors for human infection and implement more refined risk reduction measures. Field investigations of cases of H5N1 in humans—usually in locations of low or middle income countries—are generally difficult to conduct, especially in a timely manner, and may result in collection of incomplete exposure information. Conversely, in some countries, good exposure data has been collected during outbreak investigations, but may not be analyzed or published. Thus, information on potential exposures, when given, is typically limited to recent contact with sick or dead poultry 14 or the preparation of sick birds for consumption 15. More detailed knowledge of the types of behaviors and interactions with poultry that result in virus transmission would facilitate more effective and targeted risk reduction measures at the human-animal interface.Several epidemiologic studies have been published to evaluate risk factors, including contact with poultry and poultry products and non-poultry-related contact such as from H5N1-contaminated water, for H5N1 infection in humans. Most of these have adopted a case-control (or nested case-control) design where researchers have evaluated the risk of exposure to poultry from visiting live bird markets (LBM), food preparation, caring or feeding poultry or exposure risk via contact with a confirmed human case. In 2009, Rabinowitz et al. published a systematic review of published analytical studies and case reports through 2007 on exposure variables for human cases of H5N1 infection. Since this publication, a number of published large-scale seroprevalence studies in areas where H5N1 has occurred or is recurrent have been published. Here we evaluate what is known about pathways of exposure at the animal-human interface using all available publications, including seroprevalence studies and case-control studies not included in previous reviews, which could result in human infection with H5N1 virus."

            "introduction": "Seasonal influenza virus is a highly contagious respiratory pathogen that causes over one million infections and is associated with approximately 3000 up to 49,000 deaths each year in the United States 1. Infections due to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus were primarily self-limited with the highest attack rates among children and young adults 2. Future pandemics could theoretically duplicate the high virulence of the 1918 pandemic 3, 4. In addition to pre-pandemic vaccination, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing may have important roles in reducing transmission. The current poor quantitative understanding of influenza transmission could impair the development of evidence-based interventions 5, 6.Transmission is classified as three modes, by direct contact with infected persons or indirect contact with contaminated fomites, by inhaling large droplets (droplet spray) within a meter of the source, or by small particle aerosols exhaled during talking, coughing or breathing 7, 8. Reviews of influenza transmission among human populations have concluded that transmission is by contact and droplet spray 9, 10 while others conclude that aerosol transmission contributes significantly to spread of infection 11, 12. Transmissibility is currently estimated from the spread of influenza in relatively closed populations and is expressed as the number of secondary infections derived from one contagious person (basic reproductive number R0). The R0 for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain has been estimated to range from 1.4 to 1.8 13–16, values that overlap with the R0 of seasonal strains of 1.7–2.1 17 and 1.3–4.9 for the 1918 pandemic 18. The epidemiological R0, however, is complicated by unmeasured human variables including contact behavior and pre-existing immunity 19.A quantitative measure of strain transmissibility independent of human variables would be useful in predicting epidemic potential. Transmissibility in an animal model is the combination of four serial components, first a threshold viral load in the respiratory mucosa of the contagious host, then exhalation of virus, survival of airborne virus, and finally replication kinetics of inhaled virus in susceptible mucosa 20. Ferrets have served as a transmission model mimicking many features of human transmission 21, 22. Key viral genotypic features in the hemagglutinin and PB2 segments related to relative transmissibility have been described in multiple subtypes 23–27. Studies of non-contact droplet (aerosol) transmission between ferrets have utilized continuous exposures in a side-by-side cage design to identify relative differences in transmissibility between strains. Under these conditions H5N1 avian-origin viruses were not transmitted 28, whereas seasonal strains were readily transmitted, and pandemic strains were transmitted as readily 29 or less readily 30 than seasonal strains. Recently, the aerosol ID50 has been measured for two seasonal influenza strains in the ferret model 31, 32.Our goals in this study included measuring the viral load in the exhaled aerosol under controlled airflow conditions and exposing susceptible ferrets to exhaled aerosols for only 3 hours to approximate the duration of typical human exposures. We examined ferret-to-ferret exhaled viral aerosol transmission for one seasonal and three pandemic H1N1 strains. Ferrets infected with the seasonal virus exhaled higher levels of virus than those infected with the pandemic strains, yet transmission of the pandemic strains was significantly more efficient than the seasonal strain."

            "introduction": "Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the first plant virus discovered, is a single stranded RNA virus. It is present worldwide and is known to infect over 150 different plants, including tobacco, tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers 1. Because of its stability at high temperatures, TMV resists tobacco manufacturing processes and can be present in cigarettes, chewing tobacco and cigars for many years. To date there are no efficient chemical treatments that protect plants from virus infection. Similar to bacterial infections, plant viruses are transmissible among plants by direct contact, such as from contaminated farm tools and human hands. Unlike animal viruses, plant viruses cannot replicate in humans or other animals, largely due to the lack of specific receptors for recognition and entry into host cells. However, it has been demonstrated that cowpea mosaic virus enters the bloodstream in mice from the intestine when administrated in cowpea leaves and induces the production of antibodies without replicating 2, 3, 4. More recently, a case-control study showed that pepper mild mottle virus may be found in human feces and is associated with clinical immune responses 5. These studies suggest that plant viruses may play a role in human health and disease. Until now, the possible effects of consumption of TMV in tobacco products have not been investigated.Tobacco smoking has been shown to cause cancers 6, heart disease 7, and chronic obstructive lung disease 8. It also increases the risk for development of multiple autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis 9 and multiple sclerosis 10, 11, 12_ENREF_6. Although the health risks of tobacco smoking are well documented, increasing evidence suggests that smokers have a lower incidence of some inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. For example, smoking is reported to reduce human autoimmune responses in systemic lupus erythematosus 13 and ulcerative colitis 14. Of particular interest to neurodegenerative disorders, epidemiological studies consistently show smokers to have a lower risk of developing Parkinson’s disease 15, 16 which is associated with a long duration of smoking rather than smoking intensity 17. Such an inverse association is also observed in people who use chewing tobacco 18. The protective effects of smoking have been suggested to result from the ability of nicotine (the main addictive ingredient of tobacco) to inducing immunosuppression 11 and neuroprotective action 19, 20_ENREF_15, but the biological mechanisms by which this occurs remain largely unclear. As a complex mixture of more than 4,700 chemical compounds, many constituents of cigarettes have been shown to modulate immune function including both the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses 11. Tobacco mosaic virus can survive for years in cigars and cigarettes made from infected tobacco leaves, and TMV can be found on the surface of cigarettes. Therefore, we presume that smokers are more likely to be exposed to TMV than non-smokers. We tested whether exposure to tobacco products induces immune responses to TMV in humans and compared the differences among individuals who were smokers, smokeless tobacco users and non-smokers. Identification of mechanisms for TMV-elicited specific immune responses may aid in defining the etiology and pathogenesis of smoking-related human diseases."

            "introduction": "Outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 viruses emerged in 1997 and are still killing avian hosts and causing zoonotic transmission to humans in 2011, posing the persistent threat of influenza pandemics in humans 1. Vaccination is the most cost-effective strategy to control and prevent influenza pandemics and seasonal epidemics. Most current seasonal influenza vaccines are manufactured using chicken embryonated eggs, which is labor-intensive and hard to scale up during a pandemic. Moreover, egg supply may not be available during a pandemic causing by H5N1 viruses that are highly pathogenic to chickens. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been encouraging the development of cell-based influenza H5N1 vaccines since 2006 2.Two cell lines, Vero and MDCK cells, have been licensed for manufacturing influenza vaccines 3, 4, 5, 6. In addition to influenza vaccines, Vero cells have been widely approved for manufacturing other human vaccines but MDCK cells are only licensed for influenza vaccines. Currently, there are four clades of influenza H5N1 viruses circulating in avian hosts and causing zoonotic transmission to humans. Therefore, the WHO have collaborated with reference labs to prepare vaccine seed viruses from representative viruses of the two clades for vaccine development and production 1. The current clade-1 influenza H5N1 vaccine strain (NIBRG-14), provided from the UK NIBSC (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control), is a reassortant virus containing NA and modified HA gene segments of A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) virus and the other 6 gene segments of egg-adapted high-growth A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1) virus 7. The NIBRG-14 vaccine virus could grow to high titers in chicken eggs and MDCK cells but not Vero cells which is the most popular cell line for manufacturing human vaccines 8, 9, 10, 11. Historical studies have shown that high-growth influenza viruses can be selected through continuous passages and plaque purifications in eggs and cells 12, 13. This study was conducted to adapt the NIBRG-14 vaccine virus to grow efficiently in Vero cells."

            "introduction": "The retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) proteins are key players in innate immunity and act by recognizing viral RNA (vRNA) in the cytosol. The RLR family consists of the members retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation associated protein 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) 1–3. In vitro studies have shown that RIG-I and MDA5 recognize the majority of viruses in a complementary manner. While many negative-strand RNA viruses like rabies and influenza viruses are predominantly sensed by RIG-I, picornaviruses are predominantly recognized by MDA5. The observed preferences are, however, unlikely to be exclusive and the exact role of LGP2 still needs to be investigated 4–9. In case of MDA5, a minor contribution to recognition of measles, rabies, vesicular stomatitis and Sendai virus has been reported 10–13.The RLR proteins belong to the DExD/H-box ATPases sharing a central ATP-dependent helicase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain (RD) that is responsible for initial RNA binding. In addition, RIG-I and MDA5 possess N-terminal tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) that are responsible for downstream signaling transduction 2, 14, 15. Several crystal structures of RIG-I have shown that, in the absence of virus, the protein exists in an auto-inhibited state where the RD domain folds back to the CARDs, thereby shielding them from the cytosol. Upon viral infection and initial vRNA binding, the protein undergoes large conformational changes leading to the interaction with the mitochondrial associated signaling protein (MAVS) 16–19. This leads to the activation of a downstream signaling cascade and finally to the induction of type I interferon (IFN) expression and the establishment of an anti-viral state. Although the exact nature of RLR ligands is not yet fully understood, several studies report that RIG-I preferentially binds to relatively short (between 25 to 1000–2000 bp) 5′-triphosphate double-stranded RNAs (5′-triphosphate dsRNA) like those of Sendai virus (SeV) defective interfering (DI) particles 20–23. In contrast, MDA5 seems to have a preference for long (more than 1000–2000 bp) dsRNA stretches 24, 25. Upon binding to dsRNA, MDA5 is thought to cooperatively form polar helical filaments leading to association with MAVS and activation of the downstream signaling cascade 26–28.Viruses have developed numerous strategies to evade the immune system. For instance, viruses of the paramyxovirus family (e.g. measles, parainfluenza, Sendai and Nipah viruses) encode V inhibitor proteins that specifically bind to MDA5 and LGP2, but not always to RIG-I 29–31. By determining the structure of MDA5 in complex with parainfluenza virus V-protein, we previously showed that the viral protein unfolds the ATPase domain of MDA5. This leads to the disruption of the MDA5 ATP-hydrolysis site and prevents RNA bound MDA5 filament formation 32.One of the remaining key questions in this field is how RLR proteins are able to distinguish between self and non-self RNA in the cytosol. Recently, several studies showed that 5′-triphosphate RNA is not the only RNA ligand for RIG-I. Specific poly U/C-rich regions within certain viral genomes seem to contribute to efficient recognition by the protein 33, 34. In case of MDA5, it is not known which features of vRNA are required in order to induce an immune response. Expression of subgenomic and subgenic RNA from parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) indicated that MDA5 recognizes a specific region within the L mRNA 35. For picornaviruses, it is speculated that MDA5 binds to long dsRNA that represents replicative intermediates composed of the positive genome and the negative antigenome 36. These studies were, however, based on in vitro transfection experiments and it has so far not been possible to isolate a natural RNA ligand for MDA5 directly from virus-infected cells.In this study we combined different methods, including RNA-protein crosslinking and deep sequencing, to investigate in vivo RNA ligands for RLR proteins from virus-infected cells. Based on the crosslinking we were able to co-purify immunostimulatory RNA in a RIG-I and MDA5 dependent manner from measles virus (MeV)-infected cells. Deep sequencing and bioinformatics analysis revealed that RIG-I and MDA5 bind RNA of positive polarity originating from the L gene of the MeV genome. In addition, RIG-I binds to the 5′ ends of genomic and antigenomic RNAs, which probably represent 5′-triphosphate RNA, and are therefore not recognized by MDA5. Furthermore, we showed that RIG-I, but not MDA5, binds RNA of negative polarity, indicating that MDA5 does not efficiently recognize the MeV genome. Based on bioinformatics analysis, we observed a correlation between MDA5-enriched RNA sequences and the AU content and this was confirmed by in vitro transcription assays. In summary, we report the isolation of MDA5-associated RNA from virus-infected cells and the discovery of in vivo occurring activating viral RNA ligands for MDA5."

            "introduction": "The Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus has dramatically spread throughout Southeast Asia since its first detection in 1997 1. Over 560 human cases were reported so far to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 60% of them being fatal 2. Asia has been the most affected continent, accounting for 73% of the total number of confirmed cases, and 84% of the fatalities worldwide. In Cambodia, a total of 28 outbreaks were reported in poultry since the first detection of the HPAI H5N1 virus in the country in 2004 3 and 18 confirmed human cases were reported to the WHO, including 16 fatalities 2.Buddhism is the major religion in several Southeast Asian countries, especially in Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia, where 67%, 89%, 95% and 97% of the national population consider themselves as Buddhists respectively, amounting to almost 130 million people 4. In China, although a lower percentage of the population is officially declared as Buddhist (11–16%), this proportion still represents 200 million people and in reality almost 50% of the Vietnamese are probably practicing this religion 5. Buddhist life is governed by a number of unassailable rituals. The practice of life releasing is one of the most popular in Southeast Asia. Buddhism considers that all animals are sentient beings, and have, as such, the potential to attain Buddhahood, i.e. enlightenment. Besides, according to the Buddhist principle of perpetual reincarnations, any living being has also been at one time one's relative. Thus, among all positive karma (i.e. good actions), that of releasing life is considered to be the highest. Many people, in Southeast Asia, are Buddhist followers who purchase those Merit Release Birds (MRBs), mostly Passerine species, in pagodas, raise them in cupped palms to their lips, kiss them, and then release them.The implications of such ritual in the transmission of zoonotic diseases have not been widely studied before 6, 7. However, close physical contact between wild birds and humans could be a great risk factor for the transmission of infectious diseases such as avian influenza.Although wild waterfowl is thought to be a natural reservoir of all influenza subtypes 8, little is known about terrestrial wild birds. Passerine species are known to be susceptible to HPAI H5N1 infection 9–16, even though their susceptibility can vary depending on the bird species or the viral strain. Natural infections were also described 12, 17–21. Nonetheless, the exact role of those birds in the natural cycle of H5N1 virus was never determined.In order to better understand this role, we conducted a number of experiments. We investigated the susceptibility of sparrows to HPAI H5N1 infection, their ability to transmit the virus to chickens, as well as their ability to get contaminated through contact with infected ducks. In parallel, we studied the survival of the virus on infected sparrows' feathers. This study led us to a better understanding of the potential role of the Merit Release Birds in the H5N1 virus natural contamination cycle."

            "introduction": "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) was first described neuropathologically during the fifties by Karl Erik Åström 1. It took until 1971 when JC virus (JCV) was isolated from brain tissue of a patient with PML, since then JCV was accepted as the causative agent of PML 2. PML used to be a rare demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, mainly seen in patients with lymphoproliferative disease or AIDS. Now several different drugs that interfere with immune functions, such as natalizumab, efalizumab, mycophenolate mofetil, fumaric acid, rituximab, tacrolimus, and possibly azathioprine, cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide have been associated with an increased risk of developing PML. For natalizumab and efalizumab the strongest associations were seen in patients without an underlying disease that predispose for PML itself 3–7. Thus, it is of major importance to develop measures to prevent or treat the condition, including understanding of factors allowing persons to acquire the virus, as carriers, a requisite for later risk for PML.In patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with natalizumab previous immunosuppressive therapy, an increased duration of therapy, and the positive detection of anti-JCV IgG antibodies as surrogate for the infection with JCV have been established as risk factors for PML 8–12. The anti-JCV antibody status in MS patients is determined by a commercial two step-ELISA. Around 40–50% of the adults are anti-JCV antibody negative 11, 13–15. The cut-off of the commercial assay have been validated in large multicentre cohorts of MS patients with data on JC viruria available, and the false negative rate (sero-negative, but DNA excretion in urine) was estimated with around 2.5% 9–11. In contrast, a recent study that also measured JCV excretion in urine in a comparably small study population (n = 67) indicated a much higher false negative rate of 37%, however, these cases displayed considerably lower JCV DNA copy numbers in the urine. Hypothetically, a vast majority of persons might be exposed to an ubiquitous virus such as JCV, proposed as contamination marker for human excretions, 16 but differ in replicative activity of a persistent asymptomatic infection, and potentially connected to this, the individual level of immune response to the virus. This view would fit with recent serological observations of a continuous anti-JCV reactivity in larger populations, 17 and might imply that actually not the true absence of the JCV infection, but rather the level of the replicative activity of the persistent JCV infection determines the individual risk of developing PML 18. This risk might then critically depend on host genetic factors that determine the immune response to the virus, and protect from e.g. the spread of the virus from places of peripheral persistency or latency to the brain. Genes of particular interest in this respect are the HLA class I and class II genes where different variants with different peptide presenting abilities may affect the effectiveness of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immune defence.Our aim was therefore to test the host genetic regulation of HLA genes in the immune response to JCV. We used anti-JCV antibody status and anti-JCV antibody levels as surrogate for the identification of persons carrying a JCV infection in significant and clinically relevant levels and tested association to HLA class I and class II genes."

            "introduction": "Antiretroviral therapy has been used to successfully treat HIV-1 infection. However, a subset of patients develops drug resistance followed by an observable increase in plasma HIV viral load. This “virological failure” usually triggers a change in the drug regimen. Here we examine a situation in which patients had developed resistance to most common drugs and a novel agent, enfuvirtide, was added to their failing drug regimen. When resistance to enfuvirtide developed the use of this agent was discontinued in the hope that drug-sensitive virus would outcompete the resistant virus and enfuvirtide could be given again. Despite the fact that resistance developed when enfuvirtide was re-administered and viral loads were unable to be suppressed, CD4+ T cell counts were preserved or increased. Observing increasing CD4+ T cell counts without viral suppression is intriguing and suggests that issues of viral fitness may play a role. Fitness costs have been associated with drug resistance not only to enfuvirtide but also to other drug classes 1–6. Further, despite virologic failure due to the emergence of drug resistance, continued treatment that imposes selective pressure on drug sensitive virus and causes outgrowth of resistant HIV is often associated with benefits such as higher sustained CD4+ T cell counts and reduction in the risk of morbidity and mortality 2–5. To uncover the nature of the CD4+ T cell increase and to determine a general principle that may be useful in developing treatment strategies in the face of drug resistance, we performed a detailed viral kinetic analysis of a set of patients treated with enfuvirtide in which longitudinal measurements of drug sensitive and drug resistant viral levels, as well as CD4 counts, were available.Enfuvirtide (ENF), formerly called T-20, is a 36 amino acid synthetic peptide that binds to the HR-1 region of the HIV-1 gp41 molecule, thereby preventing fusion of the viral membrane with the target cell membrane 7. It is the first FDA-approved HIV-1 fusion inhibitor 8. As ENF is expensive and must be administered parenterally, it is often reserved for heavily pretreated patients with limited therapeutic options 9–13. ENF acts extracellularly prior to viral entry. This feature provides a number of benefits, such as less susceptibility to cellular efflux transporters that lower the effective intracellular concentrations of other classes of antiretroviral drugs and little or no drug-drug interactions with drugs metabolized by the CYP 450 or N-acetyltransferase route 14.As with other antiviral drugs, in patients treated with ENF, the high replication rate of HIV and the low fidelity of HIV reverse transcriptase can lead to the development of drug resistance 14. Resistance to ENF occurs due to amino acid substitutions within the HR-1 region of gp41 at amino acids 36–45 of HIV-1 gp41 with G36D, G36S, G36V, G36E, V38A, V38M, V38E, Q40H, N42T, and N43D being the most common ENF resistant mutations 12, 13, 15. These mutations result in significantly reduced binding of ENF to HR-1 16. Since ENF is expensive and poorly tolerated, many individuals interrupt this drug once virologic failure is confirmed. In a single arm prospective study of individuals exhibiting virologic failure on ENF, selective interruption of ENF was not associated with any appreciable increase in HIV RNA levels, suggesting that the drug had only limited residual activity and hence its use during failure may not be warranted 11, 17. Observational data from other groups, however, have suggested that there may be a CD4+ T cell benefit associated with certain ENF-associated mutations 18. These data suggest that despite virological failure the drug may have continued benefit due to alterations in the virus's pathogenic effects.Interruption of ENF in individuals with ENF-resistance is associated with a rapid decay in the resistant variant 11, 13, 17. The reason resistant virus decays in the absence of drug is not fully understood. Although the rebound of archived more “fit” wild-type virus is often cited as the major mechanism whereby HIV resistance decays in the absence of therapy 13, 17, ongoing evolution within the envelop gene and the eventual selection of the wild-type virus may also account for the loss of ENF resistance when this drug is interrupted 9.Despite marked differences in fitness of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant viruses and evidence of ongoing viral evolution, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels remain almost constant during ENF interruption 13. This apparent paradox suggests that viral fitness may not be a major determinant of the steady-state level of viremia. To more fully understand the role of viral fitness as well as other parameters determining the dynamics of HIV-1 during ENF interruption, we use mathematical models to study the competition between ENF sensitive and ENF resistant viruses after the interruption of ENF and during subsequent re-administration. We consider only the V38A mutant because this single substitution in HIV-1 gp41 is the most frequently observed in drug resistant virus 19 and data on the population size of mutants with V38A are available 13. We estimate the rate of forward and backward mutations, the replication capacity of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant viruses, and the efficacy of ENF against viral fusion when it is re-administered after interruption. We also examine the effect of target cell level on the dynamics and steady states of drug sensitive and resistant viruses during ENF interruption and subsequent re-administration. Lastly, we discuss virus population turnover and plasma viral RNA levels during the presence and absence of the drug."

            "introduction": "More than 25 million people have died of AIDS since 1981 and an estimated 33 million people are currently living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) 1. An effective vaccine remains the best option for ending the HIV pandemic. Models predict that even a partially effective vaccine introduced in high-risk countries could dramatically affect the number of new infections. For example, a vaccine with 50% efficacy administered to 30% of the general population would avert more than 5 million infections over 10 years, on top of any effect due to other preventative strategies 2 3. Live-attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaccines have provided the most effective protection from progressive disease caused by homologous SIV infection of Rhesus macaques 4–6; however, vaccines based on attenuated HIV-1 present too great a safety concern as a potential human vaccine. Attempts to develop a vaccine from inactivated HIV particles have failed, likely due to multiple factors such as poor growth and incorporation of the Envelope (Env) at low densities 7–11. Therefore, other vaccine strategies, such as recombinant viral vectors carrying HIV immunogens, must be considered. Currently, replicating viral vectors are being tested as potential HIV-1 vaccine candidates because they can efficiently deliver vaccine immunogens in the context of a viral infection and have the potential to elicit cellular and humoral responses 12. Moreover, the efficacy of live attenuated viral vaccines that protect from diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella 13–15 provide a compelling rationale for developing an HIV vaccine based on a replicating vector.Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is particularly suitable for vaccine vector development. It infects multiple cell types, expresses foreign proteins abundantly, is highly immunogenic, and is not known to undergo homologous recombination, which is an important consideration for vaccine safety 16–18. The viral genes are arranged in the VSV negative-sense RNA genome in the order 3′- n (Nucleocapsid)- p (Polymerase)- m (Matrix)- g (Surface Glycoprotein)- l (Large Protein)-5′, commonly known as the 5 ‘positions’ of the VSV genome due to its positional transcription gradient (Fig. 1). Transcription of the 5 mRNAs initiates from a single promoter at the 3′ terminus of the genome. Following transcription of n, intergenic regions control mRNA synthesis of the subsequent genes through a process of transcription termination and reinitiation. As reinitiation is not 100% efficient, a 3′ – 5′ transcription gradient is created with genes in the most 3′ ‘positions’ ultimately generating relatively abundant amounts of protein 19. This feature of the VSV genome makes it a desirable candidate as a recombinant vaccine vector as it can be used to control gene expression and attenuate replication 18. Immunogenicity of candidate recombinant VSV (rVSV) vectors has been confirmed in preclinical studies with a substantial range of immunogens derived from pathogens including influenza virus, Hepatitis C, and Ebola virus. Furthermore, although human infection with VSV is uncommon and is not associated with serious illness, people infected with the virus do produce antibodies (Abs) 18, 20–22. Currently, highly attenuated VSV encoding HIV Gag is undergoing clinical assessment as a vaccine vector (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01438606) 23, 24. Finally, VSV particles are known to incorporate foreign glycoproteins including Env during budding, which was advantageous for our research on live vectors designed to induce Abs against Env trimers 25–27.10.1371/journal.pone.0106597.g001Figure 1\nGenetic layout of the rVSV-EnvG4-G6 vector, HIV-1 Env, and the EnvG insert.\nVSV genes are shown in the 3′ to 5′ orientation as ordered on the recombinant genomic VSV plasmid and are not to scale. Arrows below each VSV gene depict the diminishing 3′-to-5′ mRNA transcription gradient. ss: signal sequence. MPER: membrane proximal external region. TM: transmembrane domain. CT: cytoplasmic tail domain. Star denotes site of intracellular Env(G) cleavage by furin.\nLike HIV, VSV naturally enters through mucosal surfaces and infection presents the surface protein (G) as a trimer on infected cells and progeny virus particles 16–18. Previous work by Rose, et al. demonstrated significant protection from SHIV 89.6P challenge after rhesus macaques (RMs) were immunized with rVSV vectors encoding SIV Gag and HIV-1 Env, with control of SHIV replication in vaccinated animals extending beyond 5 years 18, 28, 29 The rVSVs employed in this pioneering study were designed with either env or gag inserted after G, in the 5th position (rVSV-G4-Gag5/EnvG5; subscript numbers denote genomic positions as defined in Fig. 1), minimally disturbing the native gene configuration 19, 30, 31. Though no pathogenesis was associated with inoculating macaques with rVSV in the Rose et al. study, intranasal (IN) inoculation of BALB/c mice with rVSV-G4-EnvG5 induced a 5%–15% loss of initial body weight, and intracranial inoculation of a similar rVSV (rVSV-Gag1-G4) was shown to induce significant neurovirulence (NV) and mortality 18, 28. Furthermore, in a NV study conducted with cynomolgus macaques, 1 of 4 animals inoculated intrathalmically with rVSV-G4-Gag5 demonstrated significant NV similar to that resulting from wild-type (WT) VSV 18, 32.Following from previous work with rVSV-HIV vectors, our objective was to develop a genetically-stable live rVSV vector that would deliver abundant and authentic Env trimers that closely imitated functional membrane-bound trimeric spikes. We are pursuing this live vector design because trimeric Env spikes are the only known targets of HIV neutralizing Abs (nAbs), and to date, broadly nAbs have been induced only in HIV-infected patients exposed to Env trimers on infected cells and progeny HIV particles 33–35. To better imitate progeny HIV particles and potentially improve Env immunogenicity, we designed our vectors to take advantage of the fact that VSV can incorporate Env during the budding process 16, 17, 36, 37, particularly when the Env cytoplasmic tail (CT) is deleted.Here we describe investigation of several Env and VSV modifications to determine if genetically stable rVSV vectors can be engineered with minimal disruption to the potent gene expression apparatus that are safe to administer, incorporate relatively high quantities of Env spikes into virus particles, and express reduced but functional quantities of VSV G. Our rVSV vector described here encodes a functional Env-G (EnvG; Fig. 1) chimeric polypeptide composed of the HIV-1 clade B (JR-FL) Env ectodomain and membrane proximal external region (MPER) joined to the VSV G transmembrane (TM) and (CT) domains from a gene cloned into the 4th position of the VSV genome in place of G. Native G expression and virus replication has been diminished by placement of the G gene at the 6th and final position of the VSV genome, previously postulated to be an attenuating translocation 18, 38."

            "introduction": "Influenza viruses are enveloped viruses that belong to the Orthomyxovirus family. The genome of influenza A virus contains eight negative-stranded RNA segments, which code for 10 or 11 proteins 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The matrix 1 (M1) protein, encoded by segment 7, is the most abundant structural protein in the virions 6, 7. M1 is a multifunctional protein that plays essential roles in many aspects of the virus life cycle. It forms the matrix layer localized between the lipid membrane and the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) 8, ensuring the stabilization of the architecture of the virion. By interacting with RNA and vRNPs 9, 10, 11, M1 is also involved in nuclear localization 12, RNA transcription inhibition 13, 14, 15, and regulation of the import/export of newly synthesized vRNPs 16, 17, 18. As the major structural protein, M1 plays an important role in virus assembly and budding. It can form virus-like particles (VLPs) through collaboration with other viral proteins 19, 20, 21, 22. During budding, M1 brings viral components to the budding site 23, interacts with viral envelope proteins (HA, NA, M2) 24, 25, 26, and also recruits host components needed for bud completion 24, 27, 28.M1 protein is made up of 252 amino acid residues 29, and consists of two domains (N-terminal domain from 1 to 164 aa and C-terminal domain from 165 to 252 aa) linked by a protease-sensitive loop. The three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain was determined by X-ray diffraction at pH 4.0 and pH 7.0 30, 31, 32. The structures showed that the N-terminal domain consists of two 4-helix bundles (2 to 67 aa and 91 to 158 aa) connected by a helix linker (H5). The three dimensional structure of C-terminal domain has not been obtained so far, but data from circular dichroism (CD), tritium bombardment and bioinformatics analysis suggest that C-terminal domain folds into helices and contains an appreciably unstructured region 30, 33, 34, 35, 36.Previous investigations have also shown that M1 has a strong tendency to oligomerize 37. In virus assembly and the budding, the oligomerization of M1 is required for the matrix layer to form under the lipid membrane 21, 38, 39, 40, 41. Furthermore, the M1-M1 interaction facilitates membrane bending, which is required for bud initiation 38, 41. Expression of M1 alone in eukaryotic cells allows for the production of VLPs 21, 22. While in authentic virions, M1 forms an ordered structure adjacent to the envelope 42. It has been reported that the N-terminal domain mediates the oligomerization of M1. The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain showed that it dimerizes through the interaction interfaces 31, 32, and that the 91–158 aa region is the main determinant of M1 self-oligomerization 10.Interestingly, Noton et al. reported that the C-terminal domain also plays an important role in oligomerization by interacting with the N-terminal domain, but not with other C-terminal domains 10. Furthermore, Ruigrok et al. found that the C-terminal domain is involved in M1 oligomerization, for the C-terminal alone could cause aggregation 43. Studies of the behavior of the C-terminal domain have produced conflicting results, which lead to future investigation into fully elucidating the role of C-terminal domain in M1 oligomerization.During the uncoating process of virus infection, the virion is acidified by the influx of H+ 44, 45, 46. A structural transition of the matrix layer has been observed when the virus was incubated at low pH 42. Recent research by cryo-electron tomography further showed that the intermolecular interactions in the M1 layer are affected when the virions were incubated at pH 4.9, and the matrix layer was no longer seen in the virions 47. The interaction between M1 and vRNP has also been shown to be disrupted by low pH 9. Zhirnov found that M1 extracted from M1-vRNP complexes at an acidic pH is in a monomeric form and does not aggregate after pH neutralization 9, 15. But the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain solved by Harris at pH 4.0 suggested that this domain is a dimer 32. Therefore, it is not certain which oligomerization state of M1 forms in acidic pH, and how the influence of pH affects the oligomerization of M1.In order to resolve these aforementioned issues, we investigated the oligomerization of M1 and determined the individual contribution of the N- and C-terminal domains. We found that the oligomerization of M1 is pH-dependent. M1 can form multiple-ordered oligomers at neutral pH, and those oligomers dissociate at acidic pH to dimeric form. Further studies revealed that pH-dependent oligomerization characteristic of M1 is due to the N-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain exists as a stable dimer in solution, independent of pH and concentration."

            "introduction": "Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) are members of the Filoviridae family causing a lethal viral haemorrhagic fever (HF). Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), is the most virulent species in the Ebola genus with human case fatality rates of over 80%, 1–5. Sporadic outbreaks of ZEBOV have occurred in Central Africa since 1976 causing more than 1,800 human cases, as well as epidemics among chimpanzees and great apes 6–9. Populations of wild apes in Central Africa have been decimated and there is a significant risk that these populations could become extinct because of ongoing outbreaks 7. Importantly in the bordering region between Gabon and the Republic of Congo, human outbreaks have been shown to correspond to outbreaks in great apes, and so preventing disease in these animals could potentially prevent many human cases.Experimental infections of non-human primates (NHPs) with ZEBOV by intramuscular injection or mucosal exposure results in a disease with symptomology similar to humans 10–12. Transmission of ZEBOV is generally through exposure to infected bodily fluids via either breaks and abrasions of the skin, or through mucosal surfaces. It is currently unknown which plays a more prominent role in the spread of disease. However, infection can occur via aerosol administration 13. In addition, there is evidence that ZEBOV can be transmitted between experimentally inoculated monkeys and naïve controls probably by virus-laden droplets secreted or excreted leading to mucosal infection 14. For this reason there is concern of EBOV being incorporated into a biological weapon. In addition, research was conducted into the use of weaponized MARV with the most likely means of dispersal through aerosol generation 15. The severity and high fatality of the disease, in addition to the possibility of EBOV or MARV to be used as a bioterrorist weapon has necessitated the research and development of vaccines for both EBOV and MARV. Currently there is no preventative vaccine or post-exposure treatment option approved for human or animal use.Early attempts at creating a vaccine included γ-irradiated MARV 16 or ZEBOV 10; or formalin-inactivated ZEBOV 17. These vaccines were able to provide protection in guinea pigs, but in the NHP model the vaccines failed to protect. Recent attempts focusing on DNA and viral based vaccines, or virus like particles (VLP) have been more promising. These newer vaccines are more effective in several animal models however, to date only five EBOV vaccine platforms have demonstrated over 80% efficacy in the more stringent NHP model 18–26. Previously, we described the generation and use of live attenuated recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) with the VSV glycoprotein replaced by the glycoprotein of ZEBOV (VSVΔG/ZEBOVGP) or MARV (VSVΔG/MARVGP) 27. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these live attenuated recombinant VSV vaccines completely protect NHPs against lethal challenge with the corresponding filoviruses by intramuscular injection (IM) 25, 26, 28. In this study we are investigating for the first time the protection provided by intranasal (IN) or oral (OR) immunization with the VSV-based vaccines against the standard systemic IM challenge with ZEBOV in NHPs. We investigated the humoral and cellular immune responses following vaccination as well as the long term memory B and T cell immune responses post-challenge."

            "introduction": "Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are considered immunocompromised based on hypogammaglobulinemia and disturbance of complement activity or neutrophil function that is particularly characteristic for advanced stages of the disease 1. Accordingly, the 5-year risk for severe infections was 26% overall which increased to 57% when IgG levels were low, and up to 68% for patients with both low IgG levels and disease stage C 2. In contrast, cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease is not an issue in untreated CLL patients 3,4. CMV-specific immune response may be preserved even in cases with progressive disease. Humoral immunity provides the host with effective instruments for the protection against CMV disease. Total CMV-specific, neutralizing antibodies prevent cell-to-cell spread of the virus, block entry of virions into target cells, and limit viral dissemination in the case of reactivation from latency 5,6. Accordingly, CMV-seropositive patients with an inborn deficiency in humoral immunity, e.g. chronic variable immunodeficiency, are significantly more prone to CMV disease than immunocompetent individuals 7-9. In contrast, CLL patients experience a decay of total antibody titers to barely detectable levels but not an increased risk for CMV disease.CMV-specific antibodies may accordingly follow a different kinetic than the majority of antibodies in CLL patients. Following primary infection, high titers of total CMV-specific antibodies are generated. These antigen-specific antibody titers decrease passively (decay) after clearance of the virus from the circulation but may be boosted upon re-exposure to the specific antigen in the course of reactivation or reinfection with a different CMV genotype 10. In the absence of immunological boosts, virus-specific antibodies decay exponentially 11,12. However, knowledge about the kinetic of virus-specific antibodies in association with that of total antibody levels is very limited in healthy individuals and CLL patients. CMV expresses more than 20 different immunological targets that differ with respect to immunogenicity and relative frequency of detection by immune sera 13,14. The antigens most commonly used for vaccine development are envelope proteins (glycoprotein B or H, pentameric complex) because of their high immunogenicity and induction of neutralizing antibody responses. Tegument proteins such as pp65 or pUL32 are hidden within the envelope but are strong inducers of humoral and cellular immune response. pUL32 stands apart from other CMV antigens for several reasons. pUL32 is highly immunogenic in the human host 13,14, is the only polypeptide always reactive in immuno-blotting analyses with immune sera in contrast to all other CMV antigens 15, and is also a strong CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell antigen 13-16. In addition, we found in a previous study that a panel of germline-encoded recombinant antibodies (rAbs) derived from healthy individuals (HI) and leukemic cells from CLL patients reacts with this antigen and none of the other CMV antigens present in whole virus lysates 17. The antibody binding motifs of these rAbs were highly divergent and still reacted with pUL32 of a single CMV strain. The variability in the signals measured may indicate cross-reactivity among CMV strain-specific antibodies and hence interstrain variability within the antigen coding regions of the UL32 gene 17. Genetic variability within the UL32 gene would possibly have significant immunological consequences similar to other CMV antigens such as glycoprotein B (gB) 18,19. CMV gB genotypes may differ with respect to their propensity for presentation and recognition by the immune system, modulation of the host´s immune response, virulence, and drug response 20. Nevertheless, information on the genetic variability of clinical CMV strains within UL32 is very limited despite these wide reaching hypothetical immunological consequences. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to evaluate (1) longitudinally the total CMV-specific and the CMV-subclass specific antibody response for two highly immunogenic proteins (pUL32 and gB) in untreated CLL patients at all stages of the disease in comparison to other virus-specific immunoglobulins (2), the frequency of CMV viremia in relation to total CMV-specific antibody titers  and (3) the genetic variability of the UL32 gene among clinical CMV strains from CLL patients and the general population.

            "introduction": "The avian influenza A (H7N9) virus was first reported to cause human infection in eastern China in 2013. The cases occurred in a first wave (n = 133) from February through May 2013 and decreased during the summer. However, since October 2013 a second wave of H7N9 human infection has been occurring 1. With the exception of those caused by the H5N1 2 and H7N7 3 subtypes, Avian influenza virus (AIVs) infections were generally presented with mild manifestations such as conjunctivitis and upper-respiratory-tract infections 4. But the confirmed H7N9 cases of human infection were characterized by very severe disease or even fatal outcomes 5.The virus and host immune status are primary factors which influence the consequences of virus infection. These factors are not mutually exclusive, and it is conceivable that both contribute to the complex pathogenesis of viruses. Two recent studies suggested that H7N9 AIVs possess some mutations which are associated with mammalian adaptation or increased virulence 4, 6. Several studies investigated the biological features of H7N9 patients has been report. Zhou et al. revealed the increased levels of the chemokines and cytokines in acute serum samples 7. Wang et al. found that early hypercytokinemia in H7N9 patients is associated with interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 dysfunction and predictive of fatal H7N9 infection 8. Chen et al. found that the levels of T cell subsets were lower in critically ill H7N9 patients than in recovered patients 9. However, to date, the immune status of H7N9 patients has not been well understood. In H5N1 infection and the severe H1N1 pandemic of 2009, lymphocytopenia was significantly associated with the disease severity 10, 11. CD8+ T cells, operating either via direct lysis of infected cells or by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, are critical for the efficient resolution of influenza virus infections in animal models.Studies revealed that the downregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (HLA-DR) antigens on monocytes/macrophages was involved in an immune depression status 12. Studies of human immune responses in vitro have shown that T cell responses to all influenza HA molecules are restricted by HLA-DR molecules 13. Reduced expression of HLA-DR molecules on monocytes has been observed in patients that are critically ill as a result of liver failure, septic shock and burn injury 14, 15, 16. Furthermore, some studies have revealed that this alteration is associated with reduced antigen-presentation capacity and poor outcomes 17.Although H7N9 patients generally presented with relatively severe illness, some patients recover, while disease progression and even death occurs in other cases 5, 18. However, the determinants of such diverse outcomes of H7N9 infections are not well understood.In this study, we investigated the immune status of patients with confirmed H7N9 infection to clarify the immunological differences between mild and severe H7N9 patients. In contrast to the mild cases, we found that severe patients were in a state of immune decrease which manifested as lymphopenia, low antigen-presenting capacity and reduced inflammatory responses. Moreover, we found that HLA-DR levels on CD14+ monocytes were significantly lower in severe cases. The expression level of HLA-DR on CD14+ monocytes was negatively correlated with the severity of the H7N9 infection. These data suggested that decreased expression of HLA-DR on CD14+ monocytes is a potential indicator of the severity of H7N9 infection."

Two outbreaks occurred in 1997 and 2003; between 2003 and the end of December 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) received reports of 648 laboratory-confirmed human cases with a mortality rate of approximately 60% 1. The continuing evolution of H5N1 viruses is raising concerns about a potential human pandemic due to their bird-to-human transmission capability. Researchers have also reported that several mutations in HA and PB2 proteins support H5N1 transmission among ferrets 2, 3. Reassortant H5N1 viruses bearing 2009/H1N1 virus genes have also been identified in guinea pigs 4, suggesting that HPAI H5N1 viruses are capable of adapting so as to support transmission in other mammals. Novel H7N9 viruses showing Q226L or Q226I mutations in HA associated with mammalian adaptation indicate potential for preferential binding to α-2,6-linked sialic acids for effective human-to-human transmission 5, 6. H5N1 viruses have been classified into 10 clades, with recently isolated viruses classified into additional subclades based on phylogenetic analyses of viral hemagglutinin (HA) sequences 7.The WHO is following a vaccine development strategy of creating candidate vaccines as new viruses emerge, resulting in the current list of 27 potential vaccines in response to 12 clades/subclades. There is a clear need for a broadly protective H5N1 vaccine or vaccines for inducing neutralizing antibodies. Arguably the most noteworthy attempts involve the use of AS03 8, MF59 9, and the immune stimulating complex adjuvant Matrix M 10. Other cross-protection strategies include the use of inactivated virus vaccines containing multi-clade 11, 12 or ancestral H5N1 virus strains 13. DNA vaccines for inducing cross-clade neutralizing antibodies associated with multi-clade HA or consensus HA gene(s) are also in various stages of development 14–18.We previously reported that N-linked glycan masking in highly variable sequences in the HA1 globular head in residues 83 and 127 resulted in increased cross-neutralizing antibody titers 19. Our goal in this study is to use adenovirus vector prime and recombinant HA protein booster regimens to further investigate cross-clade immunity elicited by single or multiple glycan-masked HAs. Our results indicate that multiple glycan-masked HA elicited the highest titer of cross-clade hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neutralizing antibodies with enhanced binding to receptor binding sites (RBS) and the stem region. We believe our findings provide useful data in support of the development of broadly protective H5N1 influenza vaccines."

            "introduction": "Approximately 80% of plant viruses depend on insect vectors for transmission 1, 2, and the outbreak of plant viruses often depends on the abundance and distribution of their vectors. Plant-mediated interactions between pathogens and insect vectors can greatly affect the abundance of insect herbivores and the epidemiology of plant diseases 3, 4, 5. Although much is known about the plant-virus interactions, however, less is known about plant-virus-insect interactions 6. We are still in the early phase in understanding mechanisms of plant-mediated interactions between pathogens and herbivores, especially when the herbivores are also pathogen vectors 4, 7. In the current study, we consider how plant responses affect the interactions between tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), the vector of TYLCV (the whitefly Bemisia tabaci), and tomato plants.Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is one of the most destructive and common phloem-feeding insect pests and is a species complex composed of many biotypes that are morphologically indistinguishable 8, 9. The two most invasive and destructive biotypes, B. tabaci biotype B (hereafter referred to as B) and biotype Q (hereafter referred to as Q), belong to the Middle East-Minor Asia 1 genetic group and the Mediterranean genetic group, respectively 9. B. tabaci was first recorded in the late 1940s in China 10, but the crop damages and loses caused by this insect were not serious until the introduction of B. tabaci B in the 1990s 11. In recent years, B. tabaci Q has invaded China 12, and Q has now displaced B in many areas 13, 14.In a number of regions of the world, invasion by B and/or Q has been followed by outbreaks of TYLCV 15, 16, which is transmitted exclusively by B. tabaci in a circulative and persistent manner 17, 18. TYLCV causes serious plant diseases in Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Europe 19, 20 and, more recently, in North and South America 21, 22. In China, TYLCV was first isolated from symptomatic tomato plants in 2006 in Shanghai 23. Since then, it has spread to Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Neimenggu, Hebei, Beijing, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hubei provinces, where it has caused extensive damage to tomato crops 15. TYLCV was not detected in China until Q became established, even though B is an important vector of TYLCV elsewhere and has been in China since the mid-1990's 14. Previous research showed that TYLCV directly and indirectly modifies the feeding behaviors of B. tabaci by altering the competition between B and Q in favor of Q 24.Plant defenses always play important roles in the interaction of insects and their vectored viruses. When feeding on virus-infected host plants, the population growth of arthropod vector species may be affected positively, negatively or neutrally 3, 25, 26. For example, Belliure et al. (2005) 27 showed that tomato spotted wilt virus indirectly increase the juvenile survival and developmental rate of its thrips vector (Frankliniella occidentalis) through the infected host plant. However, the mechanism of how plant viruses modify the interaction of plant and its vector is still unknown. Numerous reports are often correlated with increases in salicylic acid (SA). SA mediates plant resistance to biotrophic pathogens, hemibiotrophic pathogens, and some piercing–sucking herbivores 28. Extensive reports indicate that SA-induced defenses are important in regulating both anti-herbivore and anti-pathogen defense responses 29–32.The interactions among tomato's defense responses, the whitefly, and TYLCV were examined in the current study. More specifically, we quantified endogenous SA levels and gene expression level in tomato plants infested by non-viruliferous and viruliferous B and Q and compared the performance of viruliferous and non-viruliferous B and Q on SA-treated and control tomato plants. Our goals were to determine how viruliferous and non-viruliferous vectors affect plant defense responses and how those responses affect vector performance."

            "introduction": "Caliciviruses (family Caliciviridae) are small (27–40 nm), non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses that possess a single-strand, plus-sense genomic RNA of 7–8 kb 1. Caliciviruses are important veterinary and human pathogens which are associated with a broad spectrum of diseases in their respective hosts. A member of the genus Lagovirus, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), is associated with a fatal liver disease in rabbits 2. Feline calicivirus (FCV), a member of the genus Vesivirus, causes respiratory disease in cats 3, 4. Caliciviruses in the genera Norovirus and Sapovirus are important acute gastroenteritis pathogens in humans and animals 5, 6. Each year, human noroviruses cause at least 1.1 million episodes and 218,000 deaths in developing nations as well as approximately 900,000 cases of pediatric gastroenteritis in industrialized nations 7. Sapoviruses have also been associated with gastroenteritis outbreaks and with disease in pediatric patients 1. The genus Sapovirus can be divided into five genogroups (GI–GV), among which GI, GII, GIV and GV are known to infect humans, whereas GIII infects porcine species 8. No fully permissive cell culture system currently exists for the enteric caliciviruses associated with gastroenteritis in humans, hampering the study of viral pathogenesis and immunity of these ubiquitous pathogens 1.The initial events in a viral infection are induced by binding of the virus to the surface of the host cell, followed by penetration or release of the virus particle into the cytoplasm of the cell. Binding occurs through interactions between the virion and receptors on the plasma membrane of the target cell, and consequently receptors are important determinants of viral tissue tropism and pathogenesis 1. Among the members of the Calicivirdae family, an attachment factor for RHDV was identified as H-type 2 histo-blood group antigen (HBGA), and this led to further studies identifying factors involved in the attachment of the other members of the family 9. HBGAs function as the attachment factor of both human and bovine noroviruses 5, 10, while sialic acid linked with gangliosides acts as at least part of the murine norovirus (MNV) receptor 11. In addition, Tulane virus, the newly discovered rhesus monkey calicivirus, uses HBGA as a receptor 12. FCV is reported to recognize terminal sialic acid on an N-linked glycoprotein for attachment 4, with junctional adhesion molecule-1 (JAM-1) functioning as a receptor to facilitate FCV penetration and infection of host cells 5, 13. Although these reports strongly suggest that the recognition of a carbohydrate receptor may be a common feature of many caliciviruses, it is also clear that different caliciviruses recognize different carbohydrate receptors 5. Importantly, however, virus-like particles of human sapovirus genogroups GI and GV strains are known not to bind salivary HBGAs or synthetic carbohydrates 14.The close genetic relationship of noroviruses and sapoviruses found in humans and animals has led to concern over the possibility of zoonotic transmission of these viruses 15. Although animal sapoviruses and noroviruses have not yet been isolated from humans, the detection of antibodies against bovine GIII norovirus and canine GVI norovirus in human serum samples 16, 17, and the detection of human-like GII.4 norovirus in porcine and bovine fecal samples 18 suggest the possible zoonotic transmission of noroviruses. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that human norovirus GII4-HS66 strain can induce diarrhea and intestinal lesions in the proximal small intestine of gnotobiotic piglets or calves 19. There is also evidence to suggest that highly conserved receptors across host species can be shared by different viruses, even among different genera or families 10, 20, 21. Such concerns have prompted us to investigate the ability of porcine sapovirus (PSaV) to recognize carbohydrates present on cultured cells of porcine origin and small intestinal epithelial cells of piglets. In this study, we demonstrate that PSaV binds to both α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic acids present on an O-linked glycoprotein."

            "introduction": "The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) expresses structural (Env, Gag), regulatory (Rev, Tat) and accessory (Nef, Vif, Vpr, Vpu) proteins, of which the last group of proteins are dispensable for virus infection and replication in vitro, but are essential for disease progression in the susceptible host 1. Nef is an ∼27-kDa myristoylated protein that is expressed early during infection and functions as a multifunctional pathogenic factor 2. It localizes to endosomal and plasma membranes and affects multiple cellular pathways, principally cellular activation, cell survival and apoptosis, and expression of cell surface receptors by virtue of its interaction with multiple cellular proteins 3, 4.The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway is an innate response that limits viral replication in plants, insects and higher animals 5–7. Unlike in plants where the siRNA pathway is deployed as an antiviral response, animals utilize miRNAs to prevent virus establishment. Many recent reports suggest that the mammalian miRNA pathway functions in antiviral RNA-silencing to restrict the replication of infecting viruses 8. The knockdown of Dicer, a key miRNA biogenesis protein enhances the replication of influenza A virus 9 and VSV 10. Interactions between HIV-1 and cellular RNAi pathways not only restrict viral replication but can also promote latency. Human miR-28, miR-29a, miR-125b, miR-150, miR-223, and miR-382 have all been shown to target the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of HIV-1 transcripts 11–13, potentially taking productive infection towards latency. Recent advances in deep sequencing technology have also identified small RNA species derived from the viral genome in HIV-1 infected cells 14. Further, the knockdown of miRNA biogenesis proteins - Dicer, Drosha or DGCR8 result in increased viral replication 13, 15. Finally, viral transcripts have been co-localized with RNAi effector proteins in the P bodies 13. Thus, cellular miRNAs affect HIV-1 replication, either through direct targeting of viral RNAs 16 or through targeting of cellular RNAs necessary for viral replication 17.Naturally then, these viruses are also expected to encode silencing suppressors to counter this host defense 18. The HIV-1 Tat protein was reported to suppress RNAi through a direct, RNA-dependent interaction and inhibition of Dicer or, alternatively, through the sequestration of mature miRNAs 17. It has been suggested that binding of the cellular protein TRBP to the structured TAR elements present in HIV-1 transcripts competitively inhibits the activity of TRBP as a co-factor for Dicer, leading to reduced miRNA processing 19. However, other evidence supports Tat only as a transcriptional activator, but not as a suppressor of RNAi 20.The Argonaute protein Ago2, which is an integral component of the miRNA-mediated silencing pathway in animals, localizes predominantly to endosomal membranes 21. It was recently shown to be present on multivesicular body (MVB) membranes together with GW182, miRNAs and repressed mRNAs 22, 23. Blocking the maturation of MVBs into lysosomes resulted in enhanced miRNA-mediated silencing, whereas reduced silencing was observed on depletion of the ESCRT proteins, which are required for the maturation of early endosomes to MVBs 24. Thus, GW-bodies and MVBs appear to be physically and functionally connected with efficient RNAi activity. Together these studies highlight the impact of endosomal pathways on miRNA-mediated silencing 23.The Nef protein is secreted in the extracellular medium as part of nanovesicles called exosomes 25. These originate from MVB membranes, contain proteins, mRNAs and miRNAs, and are believed to act as intercellular messengers 26. Since Nef also localizes to endosomal and plasma membranes and increases the formation of MVBs 27, which are the sites for virus assembly and budding in macrophages 28, we asked whether Nef associates with components of the RISC and perturbs miRNA-mediated silencing. We demonstrate here that Nef directly binds Ago2 through its conserved GW motifs, inhibits its slicing activity and redistributes components of the RISC between cells and exosomes. Thus, Nef acts as a viral suppressor of RNAi (VSR) through a novel mechanism hitherto not observed for any other mammalian VSR protein."

            "introduction": "Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) were firstly discovered in plant following the research towards to ricin 1. In recent years, researchers commonly categorized RIPs into three types, referred to as type I, type II and type III 2. Momordica charantia L. (MC), a Momordica Linn. genus of the family Cucurbitaceae, also known as bitter melon, is served as a traditional medicine plant by Chinese from ancient to modern times 3, 4. Further research confirmed that it belongs to type I RIPs which are single-chain proteins with a molecular weight of approximately 30 kDa and is commonly localized in plant leaves, seeds or roots. Alpha-momorcharin (α-MMC) and momordica anti-HIV protein (MAP30), two major components in MC, were found to be potent inhibitors of protein synthesis due to their ribosome-specific N-glycosidase activity 5. Accordingly, α-MMC and MAP30 have been shown to exhibit antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo, including lung, colon, liver, epidermis, breast cancer and melanoma cells 6–8. Meanwhile, both of them also have broad-spectrum antiviral activities against different viruses, such as herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) 9, hepatitis B virus (HBV) 10, and acquired human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) 11, 12. In the light of these findings, high-quality samples are needed for further researches, especially in our previous work focused on PEGylation which can lead to significant reductions of immunogenicity 13–15. Herein, we develop a simple, convenient and repeatable purification method for the two RIPs, particularly during which they can be produced simultaneously in a one-step purification process. In the manuscript, this novel method employed SP-Sepharose FF, Sephacryl S-100HR and Macro-Cap-SP as chromatography media. Further studies we determined their structural characteristics and biological activities. To our knowledge, this was the first study pertaining to a large-scale preparation of both α-MMC and MAP30. The final obtained bioactive RIPs can be exploited for useful applications in clinical investigations and structural function studies, which can offer opportunities for future exploration of therapeutic agents."

            "introduction": "Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MH68) infection of mice is a small animal model that has been useful in addressing basic aspects of gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis. MHV68 is related to the human gammaherpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8; also known as Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus KSHV) – both of which exhibit a very narrow host tropism and thus have been difficult to study in vivo 1. As such, infection of mice with MHV68 allows the study of gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis during the establishment of infection that cannot be addressed for the human viruses. However, one difficulty in studying MHV68 infection is the low frequency of virally infected cells. At the peak of latency in the spleen, the frequency of infected cells is less than 1% of total splenocytes 2–4. Further complicating the analysis of latently infected cells is that there is minimal viral gene transcription. In an effort to identify infected cells in vivo, we previously constructed a transgenic virus, MHV68-YFP, that expresses the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) from an expression cassette cloned into the intergenic region between orfs 27 and 29b 4. This virus has proven to be useful for: (i) identifying infected cells early during the establishment of latency 4, (ii) tracking changes in infected cell populations when specific viral genes are knocked out 5, (iii) tracking populations of infected cells in knockout strains of mice 6, and (iv) monitoring infection in vitro 7, 8.Although MHV68-YFP has been useful in identifying infected cells during the early establishment of latency, one limitation of this recombinant virus is that it is not very useful for identifying infected cells in tissue sections based on EYFP expression. This appears to be directly related to the high solubility of fluorescent proteins such as EYFP. Thus, when trying to identify infected cells in tissue sections based on EYFP expression extensive fixation is required using reagents, such as paraformaldehyde, that cross-link EYFP to cellular proteins to preserve the EYFP signal. In the absence of cross-linking, EYFP freely diffuses out of tissue sections. While small organs such as lymph nodes do not require prolonged fixation, larger organs such as the spleen require extensive fixation. This often results in over-fixation of cellular antigens, resulting in signal loss. Furthermore, this prolonged fixation often makes spleens rigid and difficult to section. These issues have previously been resolved by perfusion of whole animals with paraformaldehyde 9 which preserves detection of EYFP in tissue section, but is gentle enough to preserve detection of cellular antigens. However, this results in fixation of the entire spleen and precludes recovery of a portion of unfixed spleen for experimental analyses requiring single cell suspensions (e.g., for flow cytometry and limiting dilution analyses). Because of these issues, we pursued development of a strategy to detect infected cells in tissue sections without the complications that arise from the need for fixation.A further limitation of the MHV68-YFP recombinant virus is that EYFP expression quickly wanes after the onset of latency 4. This is most likely due to epigenetic modification of the region of the MHV68 genome that the EYFP expression cassette is cloned into. Notably, this region of the viral genome encodes genes that are only expressed during the lytic cycle and are not expressed during latency 10, 11. Various strategies to extend transgene expression, including the use of other viral promoters (SV40 early promoter), cellular house-keeping gene promoters (ubiquitin C and e1f-alpha promoters), and herpesvirus promoters that are known to be active during latency (KSHV PAN promoter), have to date been universally unsuccessful in marking latently infected cells in vivo (Collins, Morales & Speck, unpublished data). Additionally, cloning an EYFP expression cassette into a region of the viral genome that is transcriptionally active during the early stages of MHV68 latency also failed to mark latently infected cell populations (Collins & Speck, unpublished data).Fusion proteins consisting of histone H2B and fluorescent proteins have been used to label nuclei for tracking cells, and in studies on cell division and replication history 12–14. These fusion proteins are incorporated into nucleosomes, allowing direct visualization of the chromatin in living tissues. Because these fusions are bound in nucleosomes in the nucleus, we hypothesized that this would restrict the mobility of EYFP, thereby eliminating the need to fix spleen sections. Additionally, it has been shown that a histone H2B-GFP fusion remains stable for many weeks in vivo in populations of slowly cycling cells 12. Because MHV-68 has been shown to establish long term latency in memory B cells, a population of cells that divide only sporadically, we reasoned that expression of the H2bYFP fusion protein would extend marking of latently infected cells long after transcription of the H2bYFP transgene from the viral genome had been shut down. Here we show that a recombinant virus, MHV68-H2bYFP, which expresses a histone H2bYFP fusion protein can be used to detect infected cells in unfixed spleen sections. Furthermore, we show that the physical location of infected cells in these sections correlates with the surface phenotype as determined by flow cytometry. Additionally, we show that MHV68-H2bYFP is able to efficiently mark cells at late times post-infection."

            "introduction": "The hippocampus, well known for its critical involvement in episodic memory and spatial navigation 1–4, also mediates the detection of novel or unexpected stimuli, mediates changes in hormonal regulation, and is involved in emotional responses and anxiety 5–7. These various functional processes have been related to different portions along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. Experimental findings indicate that dorsal or septal portions contribute to the efficient processing of spatial information and that dysfunction of the dorsal portion is associated with spatial deficits. The ventral or temporal portion of the hippocampus processes information related to motivation, emotion, and homeostatic state of the animal. Dysfunction in the ventral hippocampal region is associated with affective and psychotic disorders 8–12.The main connections of the hippocampus have been reported to show a topographical organization that is in line with these behavioral dorsoventral differences. The best documented are the reciprocal connections of the hippocampus with the entorhinal cortex, where it has been shown that a dorsolateral to ventromedial entorhinal origin of projections maps onto a dorsoventral termination of those projections. This longitudinal organization of these inputs is characteristic of the projections to all subfields of the hippocampus 8, 13–16. The organization of the return projections from CA1 and the subiculum is consistent with this topography 17–19. Other inputs and outputs show similar topographical organization 20; a mediolateral axis of origin in the medial septum, for example, is related to a dorsoventral terminal distribution in the hippocampus 21, 22. It has also been reported that the inputs to these two main sources of direct input to the hippocampus, i.e., the entorhinal cortex and the medial septum, are themselves topographically organized 23, 24. Whether these organizational patterns are in any way related, however, is not known.Viral tracers that can be transferred retrogradely across synapses, such as rabies virus or pseudorabies virus, allow this question to be addressed efficiently and with a high level of precision 25, 26. In the present study we analyzed monosynaptic and disynaptic inputs to the dentate gyrus (DG) in the rat by using recombinant rabies virus vectors 27–29. The DG is a main point of entry to the hippocampal network, and details about the chain of input connections to it are essentially unknown. In a recent study, a similar approach was used to study monosynaptic and disynaptic inputs to CA1 using the pseudorabies virus-Bartha strain 30. That study focused on disynaptic inputs from medial prefrontal cortical regions such as the infralimbic, prelimbic, anterior cingulate, and retrosplenial cortices, which likely to be mediated through the entorhinal cortex layer III 20 or through midline and anterior domains of the thalamus 31. In the present study we used a comparable approach but focused on inputs to the DG instead of CA1. Our study is also more elaborate in that we examined the full extent of the entorhinal cortex, including both lateral and medial subdivisions along their rostrocaudal extent, and here we report both cortical and subcortical mono- and disynaptic inputs. To compare the differences between the multisynaptic inputs to the dorsal and ventral DG precisely, we additionally used a dual trans-synaptic tracing method that can label two different neural circuits in the same experiment 28, 29. Our data indicate that for most of the cortical and subcortical inputs to DG, parallel input streams do exist in the brain, such that cells in indirect-input areas show a clear topographical distribution related to the final targets of the input streams in the dorsal and ventral DG."

            "introduction": "Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a zoonosis that is caused by different hantaviruses from the family Bunyaviridae 1, 2, 3. HFRS was first recognized in China in the northeast in 1931 and has been prevalent in many other parts of China since 1955 4. At present, HFRS is endemic in all 31 provinces of the People's Republic of China, where it is a significant public health problem with 20,000–50,000 human cases diagnosed annually 5, 6. In China, HFRS is mainly caused by two types of hantaviruses, the Hantaan virus (HTNV) and the Seoul virus (SEOV), each of which co-evolved within a distinct rodent host. HTNV is carried by striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius), whereas SEOV is associated with Brown Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) and causes a less severe form of HFRS 7, 8, 9. The incidence of HFRS is linked to the hantavirus species and is influenced by spatial distribution and infection in animal hosts 9, 10. It is also thought that human activities and natural factors are related to the occurrence and epidemic of hantaviruses 11, 12, 13.The incidence of HFRS is highly variable at both the provincial and county level. Although the incidence of and mortality due to HFRS have declined in China during the past decade, the disease has been detected in areas where no cases had been reported before 14, 15. The endemic areas have extended from rural to urban areas and even into city centers 4, 16. HFRS incidence has been increasing in some larger cities, such as Beijing and Shenyang 4, 17. Zuo et al. identified three HFRS ‘hotspots’ in Beijing and suggested that the high risk was associated with genetic variation and recombination in SEOV strains. A lot of research has been focused on genetic variability and novel variants of hantaviruses. The Amur virus (AMRV) and Puumala virus (PUUV) have recently been detected in northeastern China 18, 19. It is evident that new epidemiological features of hantavirus infections have emerged in China, however, most epidemiological studies have focused on regions that are newly or severely affected; long-term systematic investigations focusing on one epidemic area have been very limited.Hubei Province, located along the Yangtze River in the central-south China, is an area that has been severely affected by HFRS for a number of years. HFRS cases in Hubei Province were first reported in a suburb of Wuhan County in1957. Since then, the disease has spread across the province. In fact, Hubei Province was the area of the country that was most severely affected by HFRS in the early 1980s 20, 21. A large number of investigations have been done on the serological and molecular analysis of hantaviruses in Hubei Province. It has been suggested that genetic variation is ubiquitous in hantaviruses and that new genetic variants emerge constantly in the Hubei Province, which may influence the epidemic and transmission of the disease 21, 22. The HFRS infection has been existing in Hubei Province for many years however, the epidemic characteristics of HFRS are still not entirely clear. Therefore, a systematic investigation of the spatial-temporal distribution pattern of HFRS is needed, in order to facilitate better prevention and control of HFRS in Hubei Province.The current study aimed to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamic of the HFRS epidemic, to examine the changing patterns of HFRS in Hubei Province over a time span of the past 30 years (1980–2009) and to identify the probable reasons for changes in the epidemic trend of HFRS."

            "introduction": "Comprehensive bioeconomic decision support frameworks are increasingly needed to assist policy makers in managing plant biosecurity risks 1. Benefit cost analysis is a highly effective means of communicating expected net returns from investment decisions to diverse groups of stakeholders 2. For biosecurity economists, it can provide a valuable means to convey a raft of technical economic and scientific information via metrics that are easily understood by risk managers. In this paper, we demonstrate this important property using the example of Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) in Australia, which is currently being considered for eradication from commercial growing areas.Bananas are an important crop throughout the world, particularly in developing countries where their importance as a food crop is only surpassed by rice, wheat and maize 3–5. More than 120 countries produce bananas, with world production estimated to be in excess of 100 million tonnes 4. Australia contributes less than 0.5 per cent of global production 4, but banana cultivation makes a sizeable contribution to regional economies across northern Australia. In 2010, the States of Queensland, New South Wales, the Northern Territory and Western Australia produced a combined total of 301 450 tonnes of bananas with a gross value of Aus$492.2 million 6.All commercially grown cultivars of banana have evolved as a result of intra-specific and inter-specific hybridsisation, parthenocarpy and triploidy, involving the two wild diploid species Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana 5, 7. Selection of high-yielding Musa clones and current agronomic practices in large-scale monoculture plantations has given rise to the occurrence of a wide range of pests and diseases 5, 8, of which BBTV is one of the most economically important. It causes stunted growth and infected plants rarely produce a bunch 9. The virus is transmitted by the banana aphid (Pentalonia nigronervosa), as well as through infected plant suckers and other plant tissues used in banana propagation 10, 11.BBTV has been present in eastern Australia since the early 1900s. Its severity was clearly demonstrated in the 1920s when approximately 90 per cent of the Queensland and New South Wales banana crops were destroyed 12. This prompted State government initiatives to contain BBTV through eradication of infected plants and controls on the movement of planting material from affected areas, which led to a gradual recovery of the banana industry. In 1993, a five-year Banana Plant Health Improvement Project was initiated by the industry aimed at eradicating BBTV from Australia 13. Despite achieving substantial reductions in the prevalence of the virus, outright eradication was not achieved by the end of this period.In this paper, we examine a similar policy we term exclusion, which aims to remove the disease from banana producing regions and maintain their area freedom from the virus over time. We use computer-simulated economic impact scenarios to determine the likely net benefits of BBTV exclusion from commercial banana production areas. A stratified diffusion model is used to simulate BBTV prevalence and control responses under a nil management and a commercial exclusion scenario over time. We then compare these scenarios and calculate a likely financial return to the banana industry from adopting an exclusion strategy, and therefore the break-even level of investment industry and government can make in BBTV exclusion before the costs outweigh the benefits."

            "introduction": "The European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) is thought to have evolved on the open steppe grasslands of Eurasia and has adapted to mixed arable agriculture 1. It is widespread throughout Europe and occurs in a variety of habitats ranging from Mediterranean to subarctic regions and from sea level to an altitude of c.2200 m. It has been successfully introduced into exotic temperate environments (e.g. Argentina, North America and New Zealand) and thrives on tropical and sub-Antarctic islands 2. The European brown hare is the only Lepus species that exists in Denmark and although its numbers are declining, it remains one of the most important game species throughout the country 3.In the 1980s outbreaks of a fatal disease associated with severe liver damage in hares occurred in Sweden 4, 5. The etiological agent of this syndrome, named European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), was originally unknown but assumed to be either an infectious agent, most likely a virus, or a toxic chemical. In 1988, Lavazza and Vecchi identified, by electron microscopy, viral particles as the causative agent, which was classified as a calicivirus. Subsequently, EBHS has occurred in many European countries 6–23. Nonetheless retrospective serological studies have demonstrated that the virus was present in Europe and other countries since as early as 1976 4 while hunters in Scandinavia knew of the disease in the early 1970s 24. The disease is currently endemic in Europe.EBHS is a highly contagious and fatal disease that affects wild and farmed hares of the species Lepus europaeus and Lepus timidus. The adult animals, especially breeders, are more susceptible whereas animals under the age of 40 days remain unaffected. Morbidity may be as high as 100% and 35–80% mortality occurs 48–72 h after infection 25. The disease is characterized by rapid progression, mild nervous symptoms, severe necrotic hepatitis, and circulatory dysfunction in various organs 4, 26. The causative agent of EBHS is a small (30 to 35 nm) icosahedral, non-enveloped and hemagglutinating calicivirus 27. Viral genome sequencing revealed that EBHS virus (EBHSV) shares a similar genomic organization to rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), but that the two viruses are distinct caliciviruses 28, 29. EBHSV and RHDV, now classified in the new genus Lagovirus, recently created within the family Caliciviridae, have significant similarities in their epidemiology, clinical signs, and pathology 4.The effectiveness of innate and adaptive immune responses, and hence the fitness of individuals, populations, and species, is driven by pathogen exposure history and the immunogenetic repertoire of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) and non-MHC genes 30, 31. MHC genes are the most polymorphic in vertebrates 32, some of which such as DQA and DRB within MHC II have hundreds of alleles described in human and in large vertebrate populations. Most variation in individual MHC genes is concentrated in regions coding for the extracellular domains that bind peptides derived from endogenous (MHC class I) or exogenous (MHC II) antigen processing 33. In humans, some MHC alleles have been associated with resistance to specific diseases such as malaria, multiple sclerosis, hepatitis B and C, and papilloma virus 34, 35, 36; Similar associations have been described for Marek’s disease in chickens 37, hanta virus in bank voles 38, respiratory diseases in sheep 39, Addison’s disease and demodectic mange in dogs 40, 41, and the severity of parasite burden in a variety of species including yellow-necked mouse 42, Malagasy mouse lemur 43, and three-spined stickleback 44.Recently, an extensive study 45 on the level of MHC genetic diversity within and among natural populations of European brown hare from Greece, central Europe and Anatolia reported high polymorphism of the second exon of the DQA locus, one of the most polymorphic class II loci. In this study, specific alleles were identified that were unique to Greece or to the rest of Europe. In addition, the majority of the alleles were population specific, suggesting that gene flow was incapable of homogenizing the DQA gene pools completely and/or that differential selective pressures maintained these MHC allelic differences 45. Infectious agents which show antigenic and genetic variation both over time, space and among populations have great potential for selection pressure on the evolution of MHC genes 46. Newly emerged pathogens derived from antibody escape mutants, for example, may exhibit increased virulence by overcoming host immune responses and such pathogens may play a significant role in reducing the distribution and abundance of host populations over short timeframes (1–2 generations) through effects on survival and reproductive success 31.The present study set out to determine the occurrence of EBHS and EBHSV in Denmark and to investigate possible associations between disease pathogenesis and MHC class II polarisation within the European brown hare. In order to do this, we examined the variations in the DQA gene encoding the alpha-1 domain which is integral to antigen processing. There is a substantial polymorphism for DQA genes in brown hares, but they express lower numbers of alleles than other MHC genes such as DRB. Although analysis of the MHC DRB gene has been performed we avoided any association analysis with EBHS because of two reasons (a) the excessive polymorphism detected with many alleles in low frequencies and (b) the existence of pseudogenes for the DRB (Koutsogiannouli et al. unpublished data, Smith et al 2011 47). Both parameters could blur the picture of susceptibility/resistance associations between DRB and EBHS. Hence, we proposed that DQA offered a greater potential for identifying complex associations between susceptibility or resistance to diseases related to MHC variation, as it suffers to a lesser extent from the analytical complications arising from high allelic diversity."

            "introduction": "Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) is a ubiquitous human pathogen that causes varicella (chickenpox) in children and zoster (shingles) in adults 1. Primary infection with VZV initiates at the mucosal epithelium following contact with respiratory droplets or skin vesicle fluid from infected individuals 2. Viral dissemination in the host occurs by T cell-associated viremia resulting in the infection of skin cells, formation of lesions (chickenpox), and the establishment of latency in neurons of sensory nerve ganglia 3. Reactivation of VZV from latently infected neurons causes shingles, potentially leading to postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a condition characterized by severe pain that can last from days to months and in rare cases, for years 4, 5.Entry of enveloped viruses, including herpesviruses, into a host cell requires fusion of the virion envelope with the host cell membrane 6. Some enveloped RNA viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus and DNA viruses, also induce fusion of cell membranes between the infected cells resulting in the formation of a multi-nucleated cell called a syncytium 7, 8. For VZV, syncytia formation is a hallmark of infection observed in skin lesions as well as trigeminal ganglia taken from cadavers when the individual had zoster at the time of death 9, 10. Fusion between neurons and their satellite cells in ganglia has been postulated to contribute to the extensive damage caused by VZV reactivation in sensory nerve ganglia and to be a factor for PHN 11. Mechanisms that regulate VZV syncytia formation can be assessed in cultured melanoma cells and examined for their role in pathogenesis using the human skin and dorsal root ganglia xenografts in the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model 11, 12.The minimal herpesvirus proteins required for fusion have been determined using virus-free assays that utilize cell-cell fusion as a surrogate for virion envelope and cell membrane fusion. The requirements for fusion in vitro differ among the herpesviruses but consist of a core set of glycoproteins that includes glycoprotein B (gB) and the heterodimer of glycoproteins H (gH) and L (gL) 13. Among alphaherpesviruses, transient expression of gB and gH-gL of VZV and pseudorabies virus (PrV) has been demonstrated to be necessary and sufficient for inducing cell fusion in transfected cells 14, 15, with the caveat that the last eight amino acids (834-841) of VZV gH must be removed for the detection of enhanced fusion under these conditions 15. Other herpesviruses require additional accessory proteins for fusion, such as gD of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and gp42 of Epstein Barr Virus for certain cell types 16, 17. While transient expression of these glycoproteins induces cell fusion in vitro, herpesvirus replication does not trigger syncytia formation, with the exception of VZV and a few naturally occurring HSV variants 18, 19. Given the differences in requirements for herpesvirus fusion and virally induced syncytia formation, it is necessary to define the functional role of the fusion machinery components of specific herpesviruses independently.Similar to other herpesviruses, the fusion machinery core of VZV consists of gB, gH, and gL, which are expressed from open reading frame (ORF) 31, 37, and 60, respectively 13, 20. While the crystal structure of the gB/gH-gL fusion complex has not been determined, X-ray crystallography of the individual glycoprotein components of other herpesviruses has provided insight into their function and roles in fusion. The crystal structure of HSV-1 gB determined the ectodomain to have characteristics of a type III fusion protein 21, whereas the crystal structure of HSV-2 heterodimer gH-gL found the ectodomain to have a “boot-like” structure that differed from other known fusogenic proteins 22. The current model proposes that gB is expressed as a trimer on the virion surface with two internal fusion loops per monomer and acts as the primary fusogen during herpesvirus entry whereas the gH-gL heterodimer facilitates the fusion potential of gB 13. However, it remains unclear whether or how gB and gH-gL interact with each other during fusion and while HSV gB/gH-gL complexes have been identified in infected and transfected cells 17, 23, it is not certain if they represent the functional fusion unit. Furthermore, the absence of structural data of a pre-fusion gB form to complement the post-fusion model of gB has limited the understanding of the changes in gB conformation required to trigger fusion. Nonetheless, VZV gB is presumed to be the primary fusogen and gH, together with gL, are essential components of the complex with all three proteins being critical for viral entry and syncytia formation based upon the proposed model.VZV gH is essential for replication as shown by deleting ORF37 from the VZV genome and inhibiting VZV infection with antibodies against gH in cultured cells and human skin xenografts in vivo 24–26. Initially expressed as a 100 kilodalton (kDa) immature polypeptide, gH forms a heterodimer with gL, which is necessary for its maturation to a 118 or 130 kDa form 20, 27. gH is processed in the Golgi apparatus and traffics to the cell surface, where it then undergoes endocytosis and returns to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) for incorporation into the virion envelope 28–32. gH is predicted to have a single membrane-spanning hydrophobic region with the N-terminus facing the extracellular space when the protein is expressed on the virion envelope or the infected cell surface and the C-terminus projecting toward the viral capsid or the cytoplasm 27.Our previous work investigating the role of the VZV gH ectodomain in cell fusion led to the identification of motifs in domain I and III that were important for in vitro cell fusion and skin pathogenesis 27. Other in vitro studies of the gHcyt identified the 835YNKI838 sequence as a functional YXXΦ endocytosis motif that contributes to cell fusion when HeLa cells infected with vaccinia virus (VV) expressing T7 polymerase are cotransfected with gH and gL vectors 33. However, the role of the gHcyt in VZV syncytia formation during infection and pathogenesis has not been investigated.In a recent study, we identified an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in the VZV gB cytoplasmic domain (gBcyt) that has a regulatory role in cell fusion and syncytia formation 34. Substitution of the tyrosine residue in the ITIM with phenylalanine (Y881F) caused an induction in cell fusion at levels significantly greater than the wildtype when the gB mutant was coexpressed with gHTL, a gH construct lacking amino acids 834-841, and gL in vitro. Recombinant viruses with wildtype gH and the gBY881F mutation caused aggressive syncytia formation and reduced viral spread and replication kinetics. Severe impairment of skin pathogenesis in vivo was also observed. How the regulation of fusion by the gBcyt relates to the gHcyt has not been fully explored.In this study, we report that regulation of VZV syncytia formation by the cytoplasmic domain of gH is critical for skin pathogenesis and depends on the length of the domain, not its specific amino acid sequence. Furthermore, both the length of the gHcyt and the gBcyt ITIM must be preserved to prevent exaggerated syncytia formation and allow for effective propagation of VZV. The cytoplasmic domains of these fusion complex proteins contribute differentially to regulation of VZV induced syncytia formation, with both having essential contributions to skin pathogenesis."

            "introduction": "Oncolytic viruses selectively infect and/or replicate in cancer cells, resulting in disruption of cancerous tissues while sparing normal ones 1. These viruses, which subvert cancer cells in a multifaceted manner, are promising to overcome the resistance encountered by conventional chemo- and radio-therapies in the patients with glioblastoma, one of the deadliest cancers with dismal prognosis 1, 2. Numerous preclinical studies have shown the feasibility and efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy in a variety of cancers 3. Emerging preclinical and clinical evidence also suggests, in addition to the direct lysis of cancer cells, the host immune response may be critical to the efficacy of virotherapy 4. However, the mechanism of the immunological effect is still poorly understood, especially for oncolytic human Ad5-based vectors. One main reason is the lack of an immunocompetent and replication-competent animal model for human adenovirus. Although Syrian hamster was used for evaluating the therapeutic effect of oncolytic adenovirus for several cancers 5, it is only semi-permissive for adenoviral replication. Moreover, immunological reagents are very limited in this animal system. On the other hand, although mouse cells are generally considered more deficient for adenoviral replication, a couple of mouse tumor cells are reported to be able to partially support adenoviral replication and have been used in immunocompetent mouse to evaluate the therapeutic effect of oncolytic adenoviruses 6. In a recently report, an oncolytic adenovirus enhanced for toll-like receptor 9 stimulation increases antitumor immune responses in an immunocompetent melanoma mouse model 7. Furthermore, one advantage of mouse model is that more materials are available for immunological studies.In our preclinical studies, we have demonstrated that Dlta-24-RGD, a cancer-selective oncolytic andenovirus, preferentially lyses malignant glioma and glioma stem cells 8, 9. In the immune competent context, viral infection itself and lysis of the cancer cells by the virus releases damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that can be recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRR) expressed by cells of the innate immune system 10, 11. The activation of PRR induces the production of large amount of proinflammationary cytokines, such as type I IFNs and IFNγ 12, 13, resulting in a Th1 immune response. As a major cytokine in many viral infections, IFNγ upregulates the expression of MHC class I 14 and three immunoproteasome subunits β1i (LMP2), β2i (MECL-1), and β5i (LMP7), which replace their constitutive counterparts, β1, β2, and β5 15, 16, and consequently increases the activity of the MHC I antigen presentation pathway 17. In addition, we reported previously that Delta-24-RGD induces autophagy and consequent cell lysis 9, 18. This type of cell death facilitates efficient antigen presentation to immune cells 19, 20. Therefore, we speculate that, during adenoviral therapy, intratumoral injection of the virus can trigger a robust innate immune response followed by an adaptive anti-tumor immunity that mediates the regression of the tumor.Here, we set up an immunocompetent mouse glioma model for adenoviral therapy. We examined the effect of viral injections on the immune environment at the tumor site and the anti-glioma activity of the immune cells. We observed proinflammatory immune response at the tumor site stimulated by intratumoral injections of Delta-24-RGD. Consequently, the virus elicited specific anti-tumor immunity and prolonged survival of the glioma-bearing mice. Furthermore, we also investigated the direct effect of viral infection and IFNγ resulted from virus-mediated Th1 immunity on the presentation of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) to immune cells by the tumor cells. Using an ovalbumin (OVA) modeling system, we found viral infection and IFNγ enhanced the presentation of TAA to CD8+ T cells through the canonical endogenous pathway of MHC I presentation."

            "introduction": "Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a small non-enveloped virus approximately 30 nm in diameter. The viral capsid exhibits icosahedral symmetry and is comprised of 60 identical units (protomers), with each consisting of four viral structural proteins VP1–VP4. The capsid surrounds a core of a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of 7,450 nucleotides (nt) long. The genome contains a single open reading frame which encodes a polyprotein of 2193 amino acids (aa) and is flanked by a long 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of 745 nt and a shorter 3′ UTR of 85 nt with a poly-A tract of variable length at its 3′ terminus. The polyprotein is divided into three regions, i.e. P1, P2 and P3. P1 encodes four viral structural proteins 1A-1D (VP4, VP2, VP3 and VP1); P2 and P3 encode seven non-structural proteins 2A-2C and 3A-3D 1–3.EV71 causes an array of clinical diseases including hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), aseptic meningitis, encephalitis and poliomyelitis-like paralysis mainly in infants and young children 4, 5. The virus was first isolated from a child with acute encephalitis in California, USA in 1969, and subsequently characterized as a new serotype of the genus Enterovirus in 1974 6. Outbreaks of HFMD with or without neurologic complications and deaths were reported in various parts of the world 7–20. Since 1997, EV71 infections have been a major public health burden and of constant epidemiologic concern in the Asia-Pacific Region. An HFMD outbreak due to highly neurovirulent EV71 emerged in Malaysia resulting in 48 deaths in 1997 21, 22, followed by a larger outbreak that occurred in Taiwan in 1998 with more than 129,000 cases of HFMD, 405 severe infections and 78 deaths due to acute brainstem encephalomyelitis with neurogenic cardiac failure and pulmonary edema 23–26. In People’s Republic of China, 488,955 HFMD cases with 126 deaths were recorded in 2008 27 and increased to 1,155,525 cases with 353 fatalities in 2009 28. In 2010, China experienced the largest ever HFMD outbreak with more than 1.7 million cases, 27,000 patients with severe neurologic complications, and 905 deaths 29.Similar to other human enteroviruses, EV71 is unable to infect animals other than humans, although rhesus and cynomolgous monkeys can be experimentally infected 30–32. Understanding its pathogenesis and development of specific therapeutics against the virus are hampered by the lack of suitable small animal models, because EV71 is unable to naturally infect small rodents. Attempts to establish mouse models of EV71 infection and disease have been made, mostly through virus adaptation by serial passages in young suckling mice 33–39. Although some models were able to recapitulate symptoms of clinical illness, none has been reported to cause disease in immune-competent mice aged 2 weeks old or older. Moreover, clinical features of disease and pathology of EV71 infections in humans and experimental monkeys could not be replicated in mice, with the exception of the immunocompromised interferon receptor-deficient AG129 mice 35.RNA viruses, by virtue of their error-prone replication and high mutation rates 40–42, replicate as a swarm of related variant sequences known as quasispecies 43, 44. It is comprised of a master species exhibiting the highest fitness in a certain environment, and of a mutant spectrum composed of a collection of closely related mutant sequences with a certain probability distribution 44, 45. These endow RNA viruses with genome plasticity, which is reflected in their ability to quickly adapt to changing environments. Despite these endowments, there has been no report of human EV71 that possesses the ability to productively infect rodent-derived cell lines, until now. This manuscript details the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of two selected mouse cell line (NIH/3T3)-adapted EV71 strains (EV71:TLLm and EV71:TLLmv), which have gained the ability to cause productive infection in cultured rodent cells due to adaptive mutations in the viral genomes. This is the first report of human-derived EV71 that have been successfully adapted to productively infect cell lines of mouse, hamster, and rat origin. EV71:TLLm and EV71:TLLmv represent novel EV71 strains with unique genomic sequences, which can be further applied in developing mouse models of EV71 infection."

            "introduction": "Influenza is a highly contagious disease that affects the respiratory system, and some severe cases could lead to hospitalization or even death. In recent years, human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses has and still poses a serious threat to public health. According to the bulletin of the World Health Organization (WHO), there were 293 deaths among the 496 human cases recorded in 15 countries throughout Africa, Asia, and Europe 1. If H5N1 viruses continue to evolve and acquire the ability to cause widespread human-to-human transmission, this could result in an influenza pandemic. When a pandemic occurs, the outbreak will have significant impacts on health systems and economies in every affected country. The WHO believes that vaccination is the best preventive method to reduce the chance of severe illness or death when humans are exposed to H5N1 viruses. To prevent such pandemics, effective influenza vaccines should be made available as early as possible.In the past, inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines have been manufactured by egg-based processes; however, the current global supply using this method is only able to cover a small percentage of the world's growing population. The efficiency of this manufacturing method is low, and it requires one to two eggs to produce one dose of vaccine 2. Furthermore, the surge demand of H5N1 vaccine would require the switch from the seasonal vaccine production to pandemic vaccine manufacturing processes that currently are the bottle-neck and inadequately addressed by the vaccine manufacturers to meet the global vaccination program recommended by the WHO. An alternative to the egg-based processes is virus propagation in mammalian cell lines which has been used for the production of influenza vaccines 3, 4, 5. Cell-derived influenza vaccines are capable of providing equivalent or even better protection in animal models than those obtained from egg-derived vaccines 6, 7. In addition, these vaccines were found to be safe and highly efficacious in humans 2, 8, 9, 10. Cell-based flu vaccines offer a number of advantages over the traditional method: (a) cell lines are fully characterized and in compliance with regulatory guidelines 2; (b) the raw materials for production are defined and can be easily produced in a short period 2, 9. There are two regulatory-approved continuous cell lines being used for influenza vaccine production: MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells and Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells 5, 8, 10. These two cell lines can be cultured either in free-suspension or in a microcarrier culture system.Serum, used as the source of nutrients, hormones and growth factors, is required for optimal growth of mammalian cells 11. These serum factors also facilitate the attachment and spreading of cells, and provide protection against mechanical damage and shear forces 12, 13. Besides these advantages, however, serum may contain unwanted contaminants which are a primary concern in the safety of biological products 14. In addition to the potential adventitious viral contaminants and prion contamination, SC medium also has other production issues such as lot-to-lot variability. SC medium usually contains a high percentage of serum content (up to 10%), which increases difficulty in downstream purification. The switch from SC medium to SF medium in animal cell cultures has become a major trend for the cell-based products 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Some influenza virus production in MDCK cells grown on microcarriers in SF medium have been reported in the literature 16, 20. Although the cell-based seasonal flu vaccines are available in European markets, there is little information available on the manufacturing processes and the culturing systems. In addition, because of intellectual property rights and the proprietary technologies used in these vaccine products, the availability of comparison studies on virus and product yield influenced by the compositions of culture medium between SC and SF medium and systems used are very limited.In this study, we describe a well defined manufacturing process for influenza H5N1 vaccine production that enables the switch from Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to SF medium (Plus-MDCK) in a microcarrier cell culture bioreactor system for MDCK cell propagation. Higher virus yield was found in the selected SF medium. In addition, the antigenicity analysis and mouse immunogenicity study have shown that MDCK cell-based vaccine produced in SF medium are equivalent to those produced in SC medium. The current results also demonstrate the production scalability from the spinner flasks to a pilot-scale microcarrier bioreactor system."

            "introduction": "Viral infections, in particular human CMV infection, continue to influence clinical outcomes following lung transplantation. Whilst intensive anti-viral prophylactic and pre-emptive strategies following transplantation have reduced the incidence of symptomatic CMV disease in “at-risk” patients, subclinical CMV reactivation in the lung allograft remains associated with poor long term allograft survival 1.Following a HLA-mismatched lung transplant, alloreactive T cells can infiltrate the lung allograft, resulting in episodes of acute cellular rejection, despite the administration of aggressive immunosuppression. Persistent activities of the same T cells are believed to be the major risk factor for chronic rejection or Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) in LTR 2, 3. There is now clear evidence demonstrating that the total alloreactive T cell repertoire consists of both allo-specific T cells and varying amounts of virus-specific memory T cells 4 that are capable of cross-reactivity towards unrelated HLA alloantigens 5. In this setting, specific viral infections can potentially heighten immune mechanisms leading to adverse clinical outcomes above and beyond any indirect viral effects.The capacity of virus-specific memory T cells to cross-react with HLA alloantigens is facilitated by the T cell receptor (TCR), which has been shown to mediate immunological responses in individuals otherwise considered to have been “naïve” to allogeneic stimulation, thereby accounting for the presence of alloreactive memory T cells in individuals with no prior sensitization 6–9. Importantly, cross-reactive anti-viral memory T cells are likely to be less susceptible to immunosuppression regimens and may exponentially expand in the setting of specific viral reactivation. It has been previously proposed that the presence of cross-reactive anti-viral T cells may contribute to a less controllable and easily magnified immunological response that can influence allograft function and survival.In patients undergoing lung transplantation, we recently described an EBV model of T cell cross-reactivity 10 and explored whether HLA-B*08:01-restricted FLRGRAYGL (FLR)-specific CD8+ T cells cross-recognizing the alloantigen HLA-B*44:02 11, 12 contributed to allograft dysfunction. Although we demonstrated that cross-reactive FLR-specific CD8+ T cells were detectable and functional in HLA-B8/EBV seropositive LTR that received a HLA-B*44:02 allograft, they did not contribute to allograft dysfunction in the absence of an active EBV infection 10. Based on this and our previous study showing that low levels of CMV reactivation were sufficient to prime and recruit CMV-specific CD8+ T cells to the lung allograft 13, we suggest that there may be a threshold level of viral reactivation(s) (i.e. magnitude and/or frequency) that is required for cross-reactive virus-specific T cells to become activated and exert deleterious effects on the allograft. Therefore, we now shift our focus towards identifying alloreactive anti-viral T cells in the CMV setting due to its tendency to reactivate much more frequently in our patients compared to EBV.CMV was a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the early days of lung transplantation when anti-viral prophylaxis was not available. Despite anti-viral prophylaxis however, CMV continues to have a propensity to reactivate post-transplantation in the immunosuppressed host 14, 15, thereby providing a source of ongoing antigenic stimulation. The relatively high frequency of circulating CMV-specific memory T cells 13, 16 and the previously reported cross-reactive nature of T cells towards unrelated HLA alloantigens 4, 17–20, produces an immunological environment where increasing viral reactivation may drive recognition of the HLA mismatched allograft. We believe that such a scenario provides further insights to previously reported links between allograft rejection and DNA virus reactivation following transplantation 21–23.The cross-reactive potential of CD8+ T cells specific for the HLA-A*02:01-restricted immunodominant CMV pp65495–503 epitope NLVPMVATV (NLV) has been previously reported by independent investigators in healthy individuals, although the specificity of some HLA alloantigens were not completely defined 4, 18, 20. However, this study showcases a fully characterized novel model of CMV cross-reactivity of NLV-specific CD8+ T cells towards the HLA-B27 molecule (HLA-A-restricted T cells recognizing HLA-B molecules) in both a healthy immunocompetent individual as well as an immunosuppressed LTR. We report for the first time in a clinical setting following lung transplantation that cross-reactive NLV-specific CD8+ T cells remain stable in the setting of persistent alloantigen but significantly increase prior to detectable CMV reactivation. However, in a specific example of CMV reactivation driven increase in cross-reactive anti-viral T cells we did not demonstrate an association between cross-reactive T cells and adverse long term lung allograft outcomes."

            "introduction": "Visna/Maedi virus (VMV) and caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) are small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV) of the retroviridae family 1 that infect sheep and goats in major sheep producing countries worldwide. The exceptions are Iceland where VMV was eradicated after a 30-year effort 2, and Australia and New Zealand where VMV has not been reported in sheep but CAEV has been reported in goats 3, 4. Once infected, seroconversion typically occurs within weeks to months and the infection is incurable. Sheep do not usually display signs of clinical disease in the first two years of infection. The first signs of disease are often loss of body condition and indurative mastitis (i.e., thin ewe syndrome and hard udder). When disease develops, severe clinical signs may include difficulty breathing, chronic wasting, loss of motor control, and arthritis. Ovine progressive pneumonia virus (OPPV) is a closely related North American counterpart to VMV and typically produces an interstitial pneumonia. Seroprevalence studies of U.S. sheep have shown that 36% of sheep operations have infected animals and 24% of all animals tested were seropositive 5. The impact of subclinical OPPV infection is significant and includes detrimental effects on sheep production from breeding through weaning 6, 7, 8. Considering that losses are cumulative during an animal's lifetime, the negative effects on ewe production and the sheep industry are substantial.Natural transmission of ovine lentiviruses is primarily among adults, occurs most frequently after their first year 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and is by the respiratory route 14, 15, 16. In addition, some infections occur in lambs by ingestion of infected colostrum and milk 8, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. Ovine lentiviruses are macrophage-tropic but not T-lymphocyte-tropic and thus do not cause an immunodeficiency in sheep 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. Persistence of ovine lentivirus in infected sheep is attributed to latent proviral DNA sequences integrated into the genome of a small fraction of monocytes circulating in the blood. Proviral DNA transcription and gene expression is suppressed until infected monocytes mature into macrophages as they migrate into the interstitial spaces of affected organs 27, 28. Once in the target organs, infected macrophages initiate viral replication, which induces an inflammatory cascade that ultimately attracts more infected monocytes and other leukocytes. These lesions increase progressively, terminating in disease and eventual death.Although there is no cure, the impact of disease can be reduced by lowering the prevalence. Voluntary SRLV control programs have been established in several European countries 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. OPP can be eradicated by testing and removing infected animals or by isolating lambs from seropositive dams at birth. The lambs are then raised on uninfected colostrum and milk, and maintained separately from seropositive sheep thereafter. Either of these methods may be used alone, or in combination, to break the cycle of transmission. However, an OPP-free flock is still susceptible to infection if exposed to other infected sheep or goats 35. Thus, efforts to eradicate OPP and maintain infection-free status would be facilitated if replacement breeding stock were genetically resistant to lentivirus infections.Examples of genetic resistance to lentivirus infection have been documented in human populations. Nearly all individuals who lack the lentivirus co-receptor CCR5 do not acquire human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection after significant exposure 36, 37, 38. Moreover, an infected person receiving transplanted stem cells lacking CCR5 may be cured of HIV 39. In the cases of VMV and OPPV, reports have suggested that host resistance to lentiviral infection may also occur in sheep 40, 41, 42, 43. Significant breed effects on seroprevalence have also been observed in comingled flocks of purebred sheep, further indicating possible host genetic restriction 10, 12. For example, in U.S. sheep the OPPV seroprevalence in purebred Finnsheep, Texel, and Suffolk was 77, 65, and 15%, respectively 12. In Basque dairy-sheep, seroconversion was strongly associated with lifetime maternal VMV-serological status and was interpreted as evidence of genetic susceptibility 44.The present article reports findings from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that used naturally-exposed ewes, together with the International Sheep Genome Consortium SNP50 marker set, to test for genetic association with lentivirus infection. Ovine DNA sequence variation in a transmembrane protein gene (TMEM154) was associated with lentivirus infection. The ancestral TMEM154 allele encodes a 191 amino acid polypeptide with glutamate (E) at position 35 and is associated with infection susceptibility. A mutant TMEM154 allele encodes lysine (K) at position 35 allele and is associated with reduced susceptibility. Two deletion mutations were also observed in TMEM154, however there were not enough individuals with these deletions to test their effect. Together, these results suggest that TMEM154 may play a central role in ovine lentivirus biology."

            "introduction": "Endemic Burkitt's lymphoma (eBL) is an extremely common tumor of young children in tropical Africa 1. Genetic, phenotypic and transcriptional analysis suggests that it originates from germinal center (GC) cells 2, 3 although it actually grows in extrafollicular locations. It is defined by a well described chromosomal translocation between the c-myc oncogene and one of the immunoglobulin loci that results in constitutive activation of the oncogene leading to uncontrolled growth of the cell 4, 5, 6. Recent studies indicate that this translocation may be mediated as a consequence of deregulated expression of the enzyme AID (Activation-induced cytidine deaminase) 7, 8, 9. AID is highly expressed in GC B cells and is normally responsible for the processes of somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination of immunoglobulin genes as they undergo affinity maturation in the GC 10. This restricted expression of AID further supports the notion that eBL originates in the GC.eBL is also closely associated with two infectious agents, P. falciparum malaria and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 1, 11, 12. The distribution of the tumor in Africa closely matches that of hyper- and holoendemic malaria 12 while EBV was originally discovered in eBL tumor biopsies. Subsequently, we have learned a great deal about the molecular mechanism behind eBL pathogenesis and the transforming ability of EBV. EBV is a B lymphotropic herpes virus that can drive the activation and proliferation of newly infected B cells by expressing a series of latent proteins and noncoding RNAs that collectively are referred to as the growth transcription program13, 14. In vivo, however, EBV establishes a lifelong, quiescent, persistent infection in resting memory B cells 15, 16. The virus makes the transition in vivo from a newly infected activated B cell blast to a resting memory B cell via passage through the GCs of the tonsillar lymphoid tissue 17, 18. In doing so it recapitulates the mechanism by which normal B cells become memory B cells (for a detailed description of the mechanism see 14).Normally deregulation of c-myc expression such as is found in eBL would lead to apoptotic death of the cell; however, evidence suggests that exposure to the EBV growth program prior to entry into the GC 14, 19 and viral genes expressed in the GC 20, 21 are sufficient to convey a level of resistance to this apoptosis. Thus, the cells in the GC most likely to tolerate the c-myc translocation are the ones already latently infected with EBV. This also places EBV at the site of eBL origin, the GC. Interestingly GC cells carrying EBV express only a limited subset of the latent proteins (default transcription program) and even these become silenced as the infected cells enter the memory compartment 16, 17, 22. Here the virus only expresses small non-coding RNAs including ∼40 miRNAs. The exception is that they also express the viral DNA tethering protein EBNA1 when the cells occasionally divide as part of normal memory B cell homeostasis 23. Viral gene expression in eBL resembles the infected dividing memory B cells, not the GC cell: i.e. viral gene expression is limited to the viral DNA tethering protein (EBNA1) and the non-coding RNAs. This led us to propose that eBL is a tumor of a GC cell that has left the lymph node to become a resting memory B cell but is unable to do so because it continues to proliferate, driven by the deregulated c-myc oncogene.While understanding the function of c-myc and EBV in eBL has progressed, the role of P. falciparum malaria has remained poorly understood. P. falciparum malaria is immunosuppressive 24 and there is considerable evidence that this leads to much higher viral burdens of EBV 25, 26. However it is well documented that increased EB viral loads associated with immunosuppression 27 predispose to EBV positive immunoblastic lymphoma not Burkitt's lymphoma 28. We hypothesize that malaria plays multiple roles in eBL pathogenesis. First, we propose that malaria has the capacity to induce deregulated expression of AID thereby increasing the likelihood of the translocation event. Second, we suggest that the higher viral burdens lead to an increased frequency of newly infected B cell blasts in the tonsils. This results in more EBV infected B cells transiting the GC and consequently a higher frequency of cells in the GC able to tolerate a c-myc translocation. Taken together malaria infection would both increase the likelihood of c-myc translocations in the GC and the probability that it will occur in a cell that can tolerate it, namely an EBV infected cell. In this paper we have sought to test this hypothesis."

            "introduction": "Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a non-enveloped single-stranded RNA virus, with ∼7.6 kb positive-sense genome. The genome includes 5′ non-translated region (5′NTR), one open reading frame encoding structural (VP4, VP2, VP3, VP4 and 2A) and non-structural proteins (2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D), and 3′NTR 1. HAV genome translation could be initiated by cap-independent mechanism through HAV internal ribosomal entry-site (IRES) with a pyrimidine-rich tract, which is located at the down-stream part of 5′NTR 2. HAV is still a major cause of acute hepatitis 3, 4. Although acute liver failure due to HAV is not common, it is still occasionally fatal 5, despite HAV vaccine having become available 6–8. This emphasizes the importance of the development of antiviral agents against HAV.In general, two distinct classes of antiviral agents, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) and host-targeting antivirals (HTAs), exist 9. Several groups have reported DAAs against HAV, such as inhibitors of HAV 3C cysteine proteinase, which is essential for viral replication and infectivity 10–15. Small interfering RNAs against HAV genome are also varieties of DAAs 16–18. Several broad-target HTAs, examples of which include interferon-α, interferon-β, interferon-λ1 and amantadine, have been developed and tested against HAV 2, 19–25. These compounds could inhibit HAV IRES-dependent translation as well as HAV replication 2, 21, 22. HTAs of the targeted group are more precise in that they act on key host enzymes or cellular factors that are required for the viral lifecycle 9.Our previous studies suggested that several siRNAs against HAV 5′NTR suppress HAV translation as well as HAV replication 17. The nucleotide sequences of 5′NTR are one of the most conserved in HAV genomes 8, 26. These facts suggest that HAV IRES is one of the attractive targets of antiviral agents against HAV. It has been reported that several cellular proteins such as autoantigen La 27, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) 28, 29, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB/hnRNPI) 29–31, poly(C) binding protein 2 (PCBP2/hnRNP-E2) 32, polyadenylate-binding protein-1 (PABP) 33, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) 34 and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4G) 33, 35, 36 could interact with HAV IRES in vitro or in vivo, and could be associated with HAV replication.Human La protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus and is associated with RNA metabolism 37. It has been reported that La was associated with U1 RNA 38, telomerase RNA 39, 5′NTR of poliovirus 27, hepatitis C virus (HCV) 40 and GRP78/Bip 41. La could interfere with IRES-mediated translation.In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic feasibility of siRNAs specific for these putative cellular cofactors for HAV IRES-mediated translation. It was revealed that siRNA against La (siRNA-La) could inhibit HAV IRES activities as well as HAV subgenomic replication. We also found that JAK inhibitors SD-1029 and AG490, which inhibit La expression, could inhibit HAV IRES activities as well as HAV replication. The present study demonstrated the proof-of-concept for the inhibition of La as a method for suppressing HAV replication."

            "introduction": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are RNA viruses capable of causing chronic infection, with an estimated 35 million 1 and 170 million 2 people infected worldwide, respectively. The innate immune response to these viruses generates an antiviral state that alters downstream adaptive immune responses to HIV and HCV. A key component of innate antiviral immunity is induction of the type I interferon (IFN) cytokine family. Type I IFNs induce hundreds of genes that promote an antiviral state in infected and normal cells 3. Further, type I IFNs can be produced in almost all nucleated cell types upon infection, underscoring the importance of the cytokine family in antiviral immunity.Endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) detect intracellular pathogens then signal to the nucleus to induce transcription of type I IFNs and other genes encoding antiviral and pro-inflammatory mediators. Recognition of HIV by TLR7, and to a lesser extent by TLR9, in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) results in IFN-α production 4, 5. This process requires endocytosis and trafficking of virions to early endosomes 6. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are also the primary producers of type I IFNs in HCV infection and have been shown to respond to HCV infection in neighboring hepatocytes or hepatoma cells via TLR7 7.Several important inflammatory pathways activated by viral infections involve activation of inflammasomes. Inflammasomes are multi-protein cytosolic complexes that integrate several pathogen-triggered signaling cascades, leading to caspase-1 activation and generation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β. Both HIV and HCV infection are associated with higher serum levels of IL-18 8, 9. While the anti-viral functions of IL-1β are better studied, IL-18 also amplifies innate immune system antiviral responses 10. IL-18 also plays a role in other inflammatory conditions, several of which have accelerated courses in persons with HIV or HCV infection, including atherosclerosis and diabetes 11, 12. These observations suggest that there is a balance between direct anti-viral effects and inflammation associated with these cytokines with resultant tissue damage when the balance leans toward “non-productive” inflammation in the absence of viral control.Whereas the capacity of HIV and HCV to induce type I IFN antiviral responses has been well characterized, considerably less is known about inflammasome activation by these viruses. We discovered that the cellular targets of the virus resulting in productive infection, inflammasome activation, and type I IFN production are distinct. Here, we demonstrate activation of the inflammasome in human monocytes and macrophages by HIV and HCV virions in a mechanism that does not require productive infection of the monocytes, but is instead dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. TLR 8 is required to sense HIV and activate the inflammasome while TLR7 senses HCV. In monocyte lineage cells, the inflammasome pathway is activated preferentially over type I IFN production by HIV and HCV even in the presence of TLRs conventionally linked to IFN-α activation by these viruses. These findings define a novel mechanism for induction of an antiviral innate response in chronic human viral infections and demonstrate that distinct TLRs sense these RNA viruses to activate the inflammasome and shape the innate immune system response."

            "introduction": "Persistent viruses have evolved to co-exist with established host immunity. Herpesviruses are among the most successful, and provide an archetype for many of the immune evasion mechanisms that underlie effective persistence 1–3. In contrast to the plethora of information about T cell evasion, relatively little is known about how herpesviruses evade neutralization by antibody. They must do so, since they continue to transmit infection despite eliciting virus-specific antibodies; by contrast, pre-existing antibodies generally block the transmission of non-persistent viruses. Epidemiological evidence would suggest that herpesvirus antibody evasion is efficient enough even to avoid much selection of viral antigenic variants 4.It is important when considering antibody evasion to distinguish Fab-dependent neutralization from Fc-dependent antibody functions such as cytotoxicity and opsonization. Herpesviruses transmit between hosts as cell-free virions. Here, antibody evasion must be an evasion of neutralization. In contrast, herpesviruses mainly spread within their hosts via cell/cell contacts 5, 6. These limit virion exposure to antibody 7, so antibody-dependent cytotoxicity is probably a more important host defence than neutralization 8, 9. Other Fc receptor (FcR)-dependent effector mechanisms may also operate 10, 11. Alpha-herpesviruses encode FcR homologs 12 that inhibit host FcR-dependent functions 13. This reflects that their latency in terminally differentiated neurons makes host colonization highly dependent on lytic spread. In contrast, gamma-herpesviruses colonize their hosts mainly by latency-associated lymphoproliferation 14–16. This may explain why they do not encode FcRs. Yet gamma-herpesvirus must still evade neutralization. A blockade of cell binding by immune serum neutralizes murine gamma-herpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) for infection of FcR− cells, but not FcR+ cells 17. Thus, opsonization can rescue the infectivity of antibody-coated virions. This implies that virion membrane fusion still operates, since it is an essential step in infection by any route. FcR-dependent infection is also described for beta-herpesviruses 18, 19. Although MHV-68 productively infects FcR+ cells, latency usually pre-dominates and virus production is therefore more protracted than in epithelial cells 17, 20. Thus, with opsonization the likely effects of antibody on transmission and cell/cell spread diverge. By diverting virions into myeloid cells, antibody should damp down MHV-68 lytic infection even when it fails to achieve neutralization. It is the need for transmission rather than the capacity to cause disease that drives viral evolution. A disease readout is therefore not the best way to understand gamma-herpesvirus antibody evasion.The MHV-68 glycoprotein-specific antibody response predominantly targets gp150, and gp150-specific antibodies account for most of the FcR-dependent infection that is driven by immune sera 21. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against gH/gL block infection at a post-binding step close to membrane fusion 22. However, gH/gL appears to be poorly immunogenic, as gH/gL-specific antibodies are only a minor component of the total response 21. Viral membrane fusion remains obligatory whatever the route of infection. So if gH/gL-specific antibodies can also block FcR-dependent infection, a weak gH/gL-specific response might be crucial to viral evasion of neutralization, and inducing stronger gH/gL-specific immunity might be a means of reducing viral spread. The steady state CD8+ T cell response of MHV-68 carrier mice is not fixed, but can be altered by post-exposure vaccination 23. Such an approach also has the potential to alter antibody responses. We have tested here whether the presentation of gH/gL alone, without its usual accompaniment of more immunogenic MHV-68 virion glycoproteins, can shift the antibody response of virus carriers towards better neutralization."

            "introduction": "Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a cellular peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that interacts with the HIV-1 capsid and is important for productive infection by the virus 1–5. Interaction of CypA with the viral Gag polyprotein in the producer cells leads to incorporation of CypA in the budding virions 5, yet it is the interaction of CypA with the incoming viral capsid in the target cell that appears to account for the role of CypA in HIV-1 infection 6, 7. CypA binds to an exposed loop on the surface of the CA protein 2. The CypA-binding loop consists of Pro85 to Pro93, with Gly89 and Pro90 constituting the binding site for CypA 2. Preventing the CA-CypA interaction by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A, which targets all cyclophilins 8, or by mutating CypA-binding residues in CA leads to impaired infectivity in most cell types 1, 5–7, 9–14. The effect of CypA appears to occur during a post-entry step of the virus life cycle subsequent to reverse transcription 12–14. However, the exact mechanism by which CypA promotes HIV-1 replication remains unknown.Inhibition of the CypA-CA interaction in HeLa cells by CsA, or its analogs leads to impaired HIV-1 replication 15–17. However, these inhibitors have minimal effect on the early post- entry steps of the virus life cycle in HeLa cells 6, 7, 18, 19. Passage of HIV-1 in HeLa-CD4+ cells in the presence of CsA led to selection of CsA-resistant CA mutants A92E and G94D 15, 20. These substitutions do not detectably alter CypA-CA binding interactions 20. Additional mutants exhibiting CsA resistance have also been identified outside the CypA binding loop 21–23. Interestingly, in some cell types replication of the CsA-resistant mutants requires CsA or depletion of CypA, indicating that CypA inhibits infection in these cells 6, 7, 24. The mechanistic basis for this cell-specific restriction is not well understood. The cell-type specific nature of the CsA-dependent mutants suggests the presence of an inhibitory factor in non-permissive cells. Alternatively, a host factor might facilitate infection of the permissive cell lines by the mutants. To distinguish between these two possibilities, Song and Aiken 18 generated heterokaryons by fusion of permissive 293T cells and nonpermissive HeLa-P4 cells. Infection of the heterokaryons by the mutants was enhanced by addition of CsA, suggesting the presence of a dominant-acting, CypA-dependent restriction factor in cell lines not permissive to infection by the mutants.A common characteristic of all the known CsA-dependent mutants is that they are rescued by a specific second-site suppressor mutation 13, 22, 23 suggesting marked phenotypic similarity, thus they can be grouped together as a single class. In the present study, we sought to identify a cell-specific host factor that restricts this class of mutants in a CypA-dependent manner, using A92E as a representative example. We quantified expression of genes in permissive and non-permissive cell lines using a human gene microarray and ranked them in order of fold-expression in non-permissive vs. permissive cell lines. We selected 26 genes with at least 3-fold higher expression in non-permissive cell lines, knocked them down individually in a non-permissive cell line, and analyzed the effects on CsA-dependent infection by HIV-1-A92E. We did not identify a gene responsible for reduced infectivity of A92E mutant in non-permissive cell lines. Nonetheless, the gene expression data reported here can be employed to guide future efforts to identify the putative CypA-dependent restriction factor as well as other host genes responsible for other cell-specific phenotypes."

Of these, T cells are a unique cell source for the generation of iPSCs because T cell-derived iPSCs (TiPSCs) have monoclonal T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements in their genomes4–7 and they can be differentiated into antigen-specific T cells for use in novel immunotherapy8, 9. Furthermore, clones and descendants of TiPSCs can be identified via the unique rearrangement patterns in the TCR gene locus5.Human T cells have been successfully reprogrammed with the exogenous expression of four transcription factors, OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC4–7, 10. Among these methods, Sendai virus (SeV) is an RNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family that replicates in the cytoplasm and does not go through a DNA phase that can integrate into the host genome11–13. iPSCs generation using a combination of activated T cells and SeV has therefore showed benefit due to the high induction efficiency and lack of genome insertion of exogenous genes5.On another front, the application of culture systems to reduce potential risks of unpredictable agent becomes increasingly vital for applying iPSCs clinically14. The initial culture system for ESC generation used fetal calf serum in the culture medium and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) as a feeder layer, introducing possibilities for transferring exogenous antigens, unknown viruses, or zoonotic pathogens to the generate cell populations15. An animal product-free medium that supports the derivation and long-term feeder-independent culture of human ESCs was recently developed16, and in the field of iPSC generation, many efforts have been made to remove potentially harmful agents from the culture system17–20.Therefore, we investigated generating transgene-free human TiPSCs by applying a combination of SeV and activated T cells into defined culture medium and feeder-free conditions towards future clinical application of TiPSCs."

            "introduction": "In vitro, EBV can very efficiently induce the activation and continuous proliferation of primary human B cells. The resulting ‘immortalized’ lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) carry the viral genome as extra-chromosomal episomes and express only nine latency-associated EBV proteins. There are six nuclear antigens (EBNAs 1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C & -LP), three membrane associated proteins (LMP1, LMP2A & 2B) and several untranslated RNA species (EBERs and BARTs). This programme of viral gene expression is known as latency III or the ‘growth programme’ 1, 2, 3.However, data on the persistence of EBV in humans are consistent with the viral genome residing long-term in a resting memory B cell population in which no EBV proteins are expressed. It is now considered probable that to establish persistence, EBV initially infects resting (naïve) B cells and drives these to proliferate as activated B-blasts. This expanding infected B-blast population then migrates into germinal centres, where the infected cells differentiate to become centroblasts, centrocytes and finally resting memory B cells. While the precise series of events that the EBV-positive B cells undergo to reach the memory compartment is unknown, it appears to involve regulated shut-down of latency-associated viral gene expression from an initial state (latency III, as found in LCLs) in B-blasts, via latency II (EBNA1, the LMPs, the EBERs and BARTs) in centroblasts and centroctyes until in quiescent memory B cells no EBV protein transcripts can be detected in a state called latency 0. When resting memory cells re-enter the cell cycle and divide, EBNA1 alone becomes detectable (termed latency I) 3, 4, 5.Although persistent infection is normally asymptomatic, EBV can be the causative agent in the benign lymphoproliferation known as infectious mononucleosis, and the virus is also etiologically linked to a number of human cancers including Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and epithelial-derived nasopharyngeal carcinoma 1, 6. In normal individuals the accumulation of proliferating B cells is counterbalanced by differentiation into memory and also the action of EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes that recognise and destroy the proliferating B-blasts 7.There is a great deal of evidence that EBV gene expression can very effectively suppress the process of programmed cell suicide known as apoptosis 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. This ability of a virus to regulate apoptosis is generally considered to be important because apoptosis is a major antiviral response used by multicellular organisms for the removal of infected cells. EBV has therefore evolved multiple mechanisms to ensure the survival of infected cells long enough for the virus to establish persistent latent infection and subsequently undergo ‘lytic’ replication to produce new infectious virus. Furthermore, B cells – the primary target for EBV infection – are particularly prone to apoptosis when they pass through germinal centres because this is where cells that are not positively selected by high-affinity binding of antigen are removed. During B cell development, therefore, multiple regulators of apoptosis act to cull B cells at different stages in order to maintain homeostasis of the B cell compartment 17. Inhibition of apoptosis by EBV is also generally considered to make a major contribution to the malignant transformation of infected cells, and hence the development of EBV-associated cancers – reviewed in 18, 19.Numerous studies of EBV and apoptosis have identified most of the viral latency-associated gene products as having some anti-apoptotic activity (reviewed in 18, 19), and a great deal of effort has gone into showing that the presence of latent EBV in BL-derived cells rescues them from apoptosis triggered by a wide range of exogenous stimuli – including cytotoxic drugs, cytokine deprivation, anti-IgM andγ-irradiation 13, 20, 21, 22. This means comparison between studies is often difficult. For instance, we recently showed that the EBV-mediated protection against apoptosis specifically induced by either the DNA cross-linking agent cisplatin, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor roscovitine or the mitotic spindle poison nocodazole is dependent on the co-expression of EBV latency-associated proteins EBNA3A and EBNA3C 21, 22. This correlates with the down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein BIM, which depends on expression of both EBNA3A and EBNA3C. This protection is independent of the tumour suppressor p53, which is often mutated in BL cells, including BL31 used in the study. However, we noted that when similar experiments were repeated using BL2 cells and their EBV-infected counterparts, both of which carry wild type p53 but fail to express BIM, latent EBV was unable to protect against apoptosis induced by the same agents 22. This is because these genotoxic agents induce the stabilization and activation of the wild type p53 present in BL2 and the activation of an apoptotic pathway that is independent of BIM. Consistent with this, EBV does not block p53-induced apoptosis after DNA-damage to LCLs 23, 24.In contrast with these observations, Kelly and colleagues found that latent EBV protects both BL31 cells (BIM-positive and carrying a mutant p53) and BL2 cells (BIM-negative and carrying wild type p53) equally well against apoptosis induced by the calcium-ionophore ionomycin and that the EBNA3 proteins appeared to play no role in this 20, 25. We hypothesised that this must depend on a second pathway by which BL cells can be triggered to undergo apoptosis, that this is independent of EBNA3-, BIM- and p53-status, but can also be blocked very effectively by EBV. Here we have explored this alternative pathway and established that it involves the p53-independent accumulation of another pro-apoptotic, BH3-only protein, NOXA. The mechanism by which EBV protects the cells from this agent does not involve any of the well-characterised latency factors (including EBNA3A and EBNA3C), but is partly dependent on products of the EBV BHRF1 locus – apparently acting alongside, but independently of NOXA."

            "introduction": "RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) are cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors that play an essential role in Type I interferon (IFN) expression in response to RNA virus infection 1. RLRs recognize cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and the dsRNA analog polyI:C 1. A recent study reported that RLRs localize on antiviral stress granules in response to cytoplasmic polyI:C or viral infection 2. IPS-1 (also called MAVS, Cardif, and VISA) is a solo adaptor of RLRs and localizes on the outer-membrane of mitochondria and peroxisomes 3–7. A recent study reported that a part of IPS-1 localizes on mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), which is a distinct membrane compartment that links the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the mitochondria 8. RIG-I is then recruited to MAMs to bind IPS-1 8. There are several regulatory proteins on mitochondria such as MFN-1 and MFN-2 9,10. Association of RLRs with IPS-1 induces the formation of IPS-1 prion-like aggregates, leading to TBK1 activation 11 and consequent Type I IFN production 12,13. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) also recognizes viral dsRNA and polyI:C; however, TLR3 localizes to early endosomes or the cell surface and requires the adaptor TICAM-1 to induce Type I IFN expression 14–16. Cytoplasmic DNA sensors, such as DAI, IFI16, DDX41, cGAS, and Mre11, recognizes DNA viruses 17–19. These DNA sensors recognize not only viral DNA but also cytoplasmic vertebrate or bacterial DNA 20,21. RLRs are also involved in sensing cytoplasmic DNA 22,23. Chen and colleagues have shown that DNA viruses can activate RIG-I pathway via RNA polymerase III 24. Unlike RLRs, the DAI, IFI16, DDX41, and cGAS DNA sensors require the adaptor molecule STING to induce Type I IFN expression 19,25,26. STING localizes to the ER and requires TBK1 to induce Type I IFN expression 19. The protein kinase TBK1 is essential for Type I IFN expression in response to cytoplasmic DNA 27. Ser-172 of TBK1 is autophosphorylated in its activation loop, and autophosphorylation is essential for triggering TBK1-dependent signaling 28. Active TBK1 phosphorylates the transcription factor IRF-3, leading to relocalization of IRF-3 from cytoplasm to nucleus 29. Recently, we showed that phospho-TBK1 (p-TBK1) localizes on mitochondria in response to cytoplasmic hepatitis C virus RNA 30; however, it is unclear where TBK1 localizes in response to cytoplasmic viral DNA. Here, we used an anti-p-TBK1 specific antibody to determine the subcellular localization of p-TBK1 in response to cytoplasmic viral DNA. We elucidated the cell type-specific subcellular localization of p-TBK1 in response to cytoplasmic viral DNA. "

            "introduction": "The majority of enzymatic (e.g. proteases) and structural (e.g. capsid proteins) viral proteins have defined tertiary structure, but it has emerged over the last number of years that many functions vital for competent viral infection, particularly in terms of host interactions, are mediated by protein regions that lack defined tertiary structure in their native state 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Their interactions may be mediated by short linear protein motifs (SLiMs) 10 and other recognition domains 11, 12 embedded within the disordered region by longer disordered interfaces referred to as disordered domains 13, or by combinations of motifs and disordered domains 14, 15. Disordered regions may in some 16, but not all, cases form a secondary structure on binding to their interaction partner. In their utilization of disordered proteins, viruses resemble cellular organisms, in particular eukaryotes, which make extensive use of disordered proteins 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.There may be particular features of the viral lifestyle that predispose them towards use of disordered regions. Some viruses are encoded within spatially restricted genomes, and being able to map multiple functions to a stretch of protein, facilitated by structural reorganization 22, may be advantageous. The ability to rapidly acquire small motifs made accessible within disordered stretches of protein that manipulate host proteins by interacting with them may also be beneficial under certain circumstances. Since during evolution viruses often cross between quite different hosts, the evolvability20 of a virus may be an important feature in certain families. Consequently, disordered regions may enhance the rate of emergence of new phenotypes, in addition to the range of potential phenotypes. The use of compact interfaces allows increased redundancy by allowing functionality to be mediated by a set of short disordered regions (e.g. the Late domains of retroviral Gag proteins) rather than on a single globular interface, resulting in increased evolutionary robustness of viral proteins 10 Thus, a deeper understanding of the role of intrinsically disordered regions in viruses is important if we are to fully understand the relationships between protein sequence and function, and also to understand the relationship between overall proteome organization and long-term evolutionary strategies of different viruses.There has been some progress to date in elucidating molecular features of disordered regions of viral proteins. Convergently evolved examples for more than 50 of the ∼150 eukaryotic motif types annotated in the ELM database 23 have been experimentally validated in viral proteins 10. These motifs have roles in manipulating cell signaling, targeting host proteins for proteosomal degradation, directing viral proteins to the correct subcellular localisations, altering transcription of host proteins and deregulating cell cycle checkpoints 10. For example, the Nef protein of HIV-1 has distinctive motifs mediating interaction with the human proteins NMT1, PCAS-1, Hck, beta-COP, and AP. The Epstein-Barr virus LMP1 protein, has motifs required for binding to TRAF, BTrCP, JAK3 and TRADD proteins, that collectively modulating NF-kB signaling. The Adenovirus E1A protein contains multiple motifs to allow the virus to alter the host gene expression 10.While the functional importance of intrinsically disordered interactionss in viruses12 has been established, to date there is limited understanding of the nature and diversity of such regions across different viruses. SLiMs can be easily and rapidly evolved de novo, whereas evolution of a globular interface for viral host protein interaction may not evolve as quickly. Viruses can acquire functional globular domains from their host, however, horizontally transferred genes are typically acquired only by larger viruses that can incorporate a stolen host gene into their genome without having to jettison other proteins that are vital for independent viral function 24. Therefore, very small viruses may have the most to gain from the multifunctional flexibility and evolutionary fluidity of disordered regions. On the other hand, their genomes may be so constrained to encode structural proteins with largely ordered domains, that may leave little room for accessory proteins with disordered regions to evolve. Intriguingly, some viruses can avoid such restrictions by encoding two or more overlapping proteins in different reading frames. We anticipated that these competing selection constraints would result in different distributions of disordered regions among different viral groups.For this reason, we set out here to characterize the variation in viral protein disorder across all sequenced viruses, to deepen understanding of disordered regions in determining key features of viral biology. We find a previously under-appreciated striking variation in the extent of disorder among viruses, and we investigate potential reasons why such variability might have arisen."

An important clinical question in transplant patients who were infected with pH1N1 during the initial pandemic was whether they would be at risk for re-infection with pH1N1 in the subsequent influenza season. Humoral and cellular responses to influenza infection are likely important in determining disease severity and recovery from infection. The humoral response to influenza includes the development of neutralizing antibodies against the surface glycoprotein, hemagglutinin. This antibody response is seen at 4 to 7 weeks post-infection and declines slowly afterwards. One study showed a 100% seroconversion rate to pH1N1 infection in healthy 14 to 20 year olds by day 30 post-infection. Antibody titers were present in only 52% of patients by day 180 4. Although the antibody response is very important in subsequent protection against infection, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses also play a role 5, 6. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to influenza has been shown to peak at 14 days post infection in immunocompetent individuals 5. A CTL response is directed towards the internal conserved proteins of the virus and reduces the severity of disease although has not been shown to prevent disease. CD8+ T cell response has correlated with reductions in the duration and level of virus replication in adults who have a history of low levels of antibodies that are then challenged with seasonal influenza A. However, this cellular immunity has been shown to diminish over years 7. Critically ill patients with pH1N1 have also demonstrated strong interferonγ, T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 response to infection early in the course of illness although the long-term sustainability of these responses is not known 8.It is also unknown if organ transplant recipients are able to produce similar humoral and cellular responses to pH1N1 infection compared to immunocompetent persons. Equally, it is unknown whether transplant recipients that recover from influenza infection retain a long-term humoral response or have a robust cellular response if rechallenged with the same viral subtype. Seasonal influenza vaccine responses in transplant recipients are known to be suboptimal. Monovalent pandemic vaccine responses in transplant recipients have been shown to be similarly low 9. Therefore, similar to vaccination, we hypothesized that transplant recipients would have poor long-term immunity to natural influenza infection and would therefore be at risk of being re-infected with the same strain during the next influenza season. The purpose of our study was to determine whether organ transplant recipients retain specific immunity to pH1N1 several months after infection."

            "introduction": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in the world 1–3. As for other cancers, the etiology of HCC is multifactorial and progresses through multiple stages 4. This multistep process may be divided into chronic liver injury, inflammation, cell death, cirrhosis, regeneration, DNA damage, dysplasia and finally HCC. Different lesions have been considered pre-neoplastic in regard to the development of HCC. For instance, cirrhotic liver contains regenerative nodules and like HCC may contain dysplastic nodules 5, 6. The principal risk factor for the development of HCC is hepatitis B virus (HBV) 7, 8, followed by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 9. Non viral causes are less frequent and include toxins and drugs (e.g., alcohol, aflatoxins, microcystin, anabolic steroids), metabolic liver diseases (e.g., hereditary haemochromatosis, a1-antitrypsin deficiency), steatosis 10 and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 11, 12. In general, HCCs are more prevalent in men than in women and the incidence increases with age.The molecular mechanism underlying HCC is currently unknown. Activation of cellular oncogenes, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, over-expression of growth factors, possibly telomerase activation and DNA mismatch repair defects may contribute to the development of HCC. Alterations in gene expression patterns accompanying different stages of growth, disease initiation, cell cycle progression, and responses to environmental stimuli provide important clues to these complex process 13, 14. In addition to primary HCC, metastatic liver disease often occurs. Metastases most often derive from gastrointestinal organs, primarily colon and rectum, though they can occur from primaries throughout the body 15. These cancers can be treated using routine therapies relevant to the primary such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgical resection, liver transplantation, chemo-embolization, cryosurgery or combination therapy 16. The characterization of genes that are differentially expressed during tumorigenesis is an important step toward the identification of the biological steps involved in the transformation process. Studies examining the gene expression of metastatic liver tumors and HCC in parallel with paired non-cancerous liver tissues might yield important insights by identifying genes not expressed in normal liver and are switched on in tumors and vice versa. Such studies should also lead to the identification of genes that are expressed in tumors at different stages and never in non cancerous liver tissue.The present study assessed the expression profile of 18 HCV-related primary HCCs and their corresponding HCV-positive non-HCC counterpart, 1 HCV-positive liver sample without the corresponding HCC tissue, 14 gastrointestinal liver metastases and their corresponding non cancerous tissue and 6 liver biopsies from patients with benign pathologies and normal liver by use of high-density oligonucleotide arrays. This represents an independent study from a previous study performed by our group 17. An HCC-specific molecular signature set was identified that may enhance conventional pathologic assessment and may provide a tool for prognostic purposes, as well as identify targets for new therapeutic strategies."

            "introduction": "The HIV-1 population within an infected individual is characterized by extensive viral variation and continuous adaptation to its host. Such rapid evolution is the result of a combination of several factors: a large viral population, high replication and mutation rates, recombination, and various intra-host selective pressures 1. The high mutation rate is associated with the inherent infidelity of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) and RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) 1 and has also been proposed to be partly caused by cellular cytidine deaminases such as hA3G, which can cause Guanosine-to-Adenosine (G-to-A) mutations on HIV plus-strand DNA 2–7. Several observations appear to provide support for this hypothesis as lentiviral genomes are adenine rich 8, 9 and G-to-A is the most frequent nucleotide mutation observed during HIV-1 replication both in vitro 10, 11 and in vivo in both acute 12 and chronic infection 13.In infected cells, hA3G can become incorporated into nascent virions as large, enzymatically inactive, ribonucleoprotein complexes termed ‘Intra-Virion A3G Complexes’ (IVAC) 14. When a virion subsequently infects another cell, IVACs become active through the activity of viral RNaseH during reverse transcription 14 and hA3G restricts HIV replication through a combination of mutagenesis (or editing) 5, 15 and possibly non-editing activities 16. Editing is easily recognized because it results in extensive Cytidine-to-Uridine (C-to-U) deamination of single-stranded minus-strand DNA during reverse transcription 5, 17, 18. The mutations appear as plus-strand G-to-A changes and hA3-induced mutations are usually reported as such and termed hypermutation 19 as G-to-A transitions far exceed all other mutations. As the preferred target is TGG (encoding Tryptophan when in frame), many G-to-A mutations will produce stop-codons, TAG, resulting in viral inactivation 17, 20.The HIV accessory protein Vif can circumvent the protective role of hA3G, and other hA3 deaminases, by targeting them for proteasomal degradation and thereby preventing their incorporation into virions 21. However, as various frequencies of hypermutated sequences are observed in HIV DNA from infected patients, the efficiency of these Vif-hA3 interactions must vary between them 4, 22–24.Two different scenarios could account for the in vivo variation in hypermutation frequency. First, editing could act to increase viral diversification, with possible advantages to the virus in a fluctuating fitness environment, but to do so, hA3G would have to induce mutations at a low, sub-lethal level. In such a situation, selection would act on Vif to moderate the number of hA3G molecules incorporated into virions. Alternatively, inefficient Vif-hA3G interactions could be the by-product of other hitherto undefined selective pressures and the resulting hypermutation considered a viral fitness cost, acting at the level of the viral population.Here, we investigate the fundamental question of whether hA3G-induced G-to-A mutation is always lethal to the virus or if it may occur at sub-lethal frequencies."

            "introduction": "Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) delays progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in most individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). HAART is characterized by the use of combination drug therapy that consists of three or more antiretroviral drugs from at least two different classes 1. Once individuals begin HAART, a rapid reduction in plasma viral RNA (vRNA) occurs and the plasma viral load (VL) is frequently suppressed to levels below the detection sensitivity of standard assays (<50 vRNA copies/mL) 2–5. Despite VL suppression, transient blips >50 vRNA copies/mL occur 6; however, in compliant individuals, blips rarely signify the development of drug resistance 7. More sensitive VL assays with single vRNA copy sensitivity have demonstrated that in most individuals, residual low-level viremia (LLV) is present during HAART 2, 5 at levels <50 vRNA copies/mL. In addition, cessation of therapy results in a rapid rebound in viremia presumably from sites of long-term viral persistence that are not eliminated by HAART 7–11. Viral persistence has been well documented in long-lived viral reservoirs consisting of latently infected resting memory CD4+ T-cells 12–15. Moreover, infected macrophages (reviewed in 16) may also represent an important long-lived reservoir that can produce virus throughout their life span due to the fact that these cells are resistant to viral cytopathic effects.It has been suggested that virions within LLV 17, 18 and rebound viremia 19 are often not the exclusive result of viral production from circulating resting memory CD4+ T-cells. This suggests that viral reservoirs within tissues may be a primary source of LLV and rebound viremia, however, the origin of these virions has yet to be fully characterized. HIV-1 infected cells within these anatomical sites may contribute to LLV following cellular activation or transient viral production. Additionally, it has yet to be conclusively determined if a component of LLV may also be due to instances of complete replication cycles, termed residual replication, in cells with sub-therapeutic drug levels 20. The ability to definitively ascertain the occurrence of residual replication during HAART is the primary goal of many current research efforts and may contribute to improved strategies toward HIV-1 eradication 21 and control of chronic immune activation (reviewed in 22). Using phylogenetic analyses of LLV, studies have reported that residual replication may occur in some patients 23, 24 while others have found no substantial evidence of ongoing HIV-1 replication during HAART 17, 18, 25. Phylogenetic studies of human LLV have also demonstrated that it is frequently marked by the existence of an oligoclonal population of viral sequences deemed predominant plasma clones (PPC) 17. A linkage between PPC viral populations and viral nucleic acid sequences in circulating resting memory CD4+ T-cells has not been well defined in the majority of studies that have reported this phenomenon 17, 18, 25–27. One study performed by Anderson et al. reported that a minority of circulating resting memory CD4+ T-cells did harbor PPC sequences suggesting that they may have arisen from homeostatic proliferation 25. Taken together, the mechanisms contributing to the production of PPC viral populations are largely unknown. In addition to residual replication contributing to LLV, it has been proposed that the rapid rebound in viremia, which occurs upon cessation of therapy, may originate from virions present due to residual replication or persistent low-level viral production 26, 28, 29. However, in the majority of individuals, activation of the latent viral reservoir has been implicated as the primary cause of rebound viremia 28, 30.To investigate questions regarding viral persistence, residual replication, and LLV during therapy, non-human primate models of HIV-1 HAART have been developed 31–35. The use of a non-human primate model that mimics the viral dynamics of HIV-1 infected humans during HAART has several advantages. These include improved compliance, the use of a genetically defined inoculum, and the ability to perform invasive tissue sampling. Recently, Shytaj et al. monitored LLV VLs for 14 to 94 weeks during HAART following an intensified HAART regimen in SIVmac251 infected rhesus macaques (RMs) 35. However, in nine of the ten RMs, LLV was completely suppressed to undetectable levels (<3 vRNA copies/mL) suggesting that this model may have limitations in modeling human residual viremia. Other studies have used RT-SHIV 31, 32, 34 which is a chimeric simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) with the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) replacing the native SIV RT 36. One benefit of RT-SHIV is that unlike SIV, the chimeric virus is susceptible to non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) 37 which are an important component of frontline treatment regimens 38, 39. Similar to humans 4, plasma VLs in RT-SHIV infected RMs decay in a bi-phasic manner and are rapidly suppressed to <50 vRNA copies/mL within the first three months of HAART 32, 40. Viral loads are maintained at this level of suppression for the duration of therapy and are associated with few transient blips in viremia (<200 vRNA copies/mL) at frequencies comparable to humans 6. In addition, our group has demonstrated that RT-SHIV infected RMs which received a three-drug HAART regimen maintained persistent LLV for at least 20 weeks following VL suppression to levels <50 vRNA copies/mL 41. Moreover, LLV vRNA levels 41 were comparable to those observed in humans during the first year of therapy 4, 5. The specific anatomical origins of this LLV were not determined. However, in tissues collected at necropsy during maximal VL suppression (VL: <50 vRNA copies/mL), RT-SHIV cell-associated viral DNA and full-length vRNA were present in many anatomical sites such as lymphoid tissues and the gastrointestinal tract 32.In this study, our primary goals were to characterize LLV genetic diversity in a non-human primate model of HIV-1 HAART and to investigate the controversial hypothesis that residual replication occurs and may contribute to LLV. To investigate these questions, we analyzed the genetic diversity of RT-SHIV RT sequences in longitudinally sampled plasma that was obtained before maximal VL suppression and during maximally suppressive therapy. Plasma samples were kindly provided from a concurrent study which was designed, in part, to assess the hypothesis that a five-drug HAART regimen tenofovir, emtricitabine, zidovudine, amdoxovir, (A, C, T, G nucleoside analogs) and the NNRTI efavirenz may differentially affect LLV and viral rebound relative to a more traditional three-drug HAART regimen. Only one other similar non-human primate study has been performed to date which was reported in 2011 by Kearney et al. 31. During that important study, the ability to achieve complete VL suppression in all six RT-SHIV infected pigtailed macaques was likely affected by the development of drug resistance following an initial period of efavirenz monotherapy in some macaques. The reported phylogenetic diversity of LLV samples with <50 vRNA copies/mL was limited to two pigtailed macaques for a period of five weeks 31. In these samples, longitudinal viral evolution was not detected and viral diversity was similar to the plasma viral RNA pre-suppression profile 31. These findings suggest that residual replication does not markedly contribute to LLV in well suppressed pigtailed macaques. Conversely, evidence of viral evolution during HAART was detected in viremia from four pigtailed macaques that did not achieve maximal VL suppression 31. In comparison, this study attempted to improve the characterization of LLV by analyzing samples from five rhesus macaques that all achieved maximal VL suppression (<50 vRNA copies/mL). In addition, we were able to generate LLV sequences from longer periods ranging from 10 to 32 weeks. The results of these analyses are reported herein."

            "introduction": "Retroviruses insert a double-stranded DNA copy of their genome non-specifically into the genome of the host and thereby act as insertional mutagens that can disrupt gene regulation or cause the production of an altered gene product 1. The integrated retrovirus, termed the provirus, contains strong transcription-regulatory signals that can induce or enhance the expression of nearby genes. When such affected genes are involved in cell survival and proliferation, their deregulated expression may contribute to tumorigenesis 2. In tumors caused by retroviral insertions, the proviruses constitute a tag allowing the identification of candidate genes with a possible role in tumorigenesis. By this approach several recent studies have contributed to the discovery of new proto-oncogenes and also, when performed in genetically modified mice expanded our knowledge on oncogene cooperativity 3–4. Moreover, insertional mutagenesis is a concern in gene therapy by retroviral vectors 5. By another development, evidence is also emerging that endogenous retroviruses of mice and humans may contribute to oncogenesis by the activation of nearby genes without any need for new retroviral insertions in somatic cells 6.Based on the analysis of somatic integrations selected during malignant transformation various types of virus-induced gene activation have been proposed. By the process known as enhancer insertion a provirus increases the production of a normal transcript of an adjacent target gene 2. In these cases, proviruses are often found outside the transcription unit of the target gene and in many cases upstream of the target gene and in the opposite transcriptional orientation. Other types of insertional mutagenesis result in the formation of chimeric RNA species containing viral and host sequences. One example of this is promoter insertion in which proviruses are integrated in the same transcriptional orientation as the proto-oncogene, either upstream or within its 5′end 2.The work reported by Martin-Hernandez et al. 7 represents an example of gene over-expression caused by promoter insertion. Three out of 13 murine B-cell lymphomas induced by the leukemogenic Akv1-99 virus had retroviral integrations into the Nras/Csde1 locus 7. In all three cases viral-Nras chimeric RNAs were detected and the overall level of mRNA with NRAS-encoding potential significantly increased, whereas the retroviral integrations did not influence the expression of Csde1. Since no activating mutations of Nras were detected, the sole over-expression of the wild type gene seems to constitute an important factor in the development of B-cell lymphomas in this experimental setting.To further investigate the processes of deregulation by an integrated gammaretrovirus and to assess if intrinsic over-expression of the Nras proto-oncogene may be sufficient to induce neoplastic pathologies, we have developed the first target-specific mouse knock-in models using retroviral sequences. These animals contain a single Akv1-99 LTR integrated at the exact same position as a previously identified retroviral integration in a tumor, placed in either the same or opposite transcriptional orientation relative to Nras and with or without a flanking floxed PGK/Tn5 neo cassette. We here report that the different alleles up or down-regulate Nras expression to various degrees dependent upon the orientation and position of the LTR. Mice of this series have already proven valuable in the analysis of mechanisms of deregulation of host genes by insertional mutagenesis 8 as well as investigation of phenotypic effects of Nras over-expression 9."

            "introduction": "SV40, a member of polyomaviradae family, has a small double-stranded circular DNA genome of 5.2 kb. The DNA is complexed with histones, forming a nucleosomal structure similar to cellular chromatin, referred to as a minichromosome. The SV40 structure has been solved at 3.1 Å resolution 1. The viral capsid, surrounding the viral minichromosome, is a T = 7d icosahedral lattice ∼45 nm in diameter. It is composed of three viral-encoded proteins, VP1, VP2, and VP3. VP3 translation initiates from an internal AUG within the VP2 coding sequence utilizing the same translational frame. Thus both proteins share 234 identical amino acids at their carboxy part, and are frequently referred to as VP2/3. VP1 forms the outer shell while VP2 and VP3 bridge between the VP1 shell and the chromatin core. The VP1 monomers are tightly bound in pentamers that are readily formed in the cytoplasm following mRNA translation, through interdigitating β-strands 2. A single molecule of VP2 or VP3 is tightly attached to each pentamer at its inward facing cavity, through a region close to the C-terminus of VP2/3 3, 4. These and other findings indicate that VP15VP2/3 is the building block for SV40 capsid assembly. VP1 has a jelly-roll β-barrel structure 1, 5, with extending N-terminal arm, that carries the DNA-binding domain 6, and ∼60 amino acids long C-terminal arm.The icosahedral capsid of members of the polyomaviradae family is built of 72 identical VP1 pentamers 7. 12 of those are surrounded by 5 pentamers each (‘pentavalent pentamers’) and the other 60 by 6 pentamers each (‘hexavalent pentamers’). The puzzle how the variability in contacts between the identical building blocks is achieved has been solved by the elegant X-ray crystal structure study, which has shown that the pentamers are tied together via the long flexible C-arms 5. Five C-arms extend from each pentamer and insert into the neighboring pentamers in three distinct kinds of interactions. It has been recently shown, by in vitro assembly studies, that the correct inter-pentamer bonding in both polyomavirus and SV40 is facilitated by host chaperones 8.The capsid is stabilized by Ca++ and S-S bonds 1. There are two cation binding sites per VP1 monomer, which appear to stabilize the capsid by “locking” the invading C-arm 1. Mutations in putative Ca++ binding acidic residues suggested that Ca++ coordination is important for both virus assembly and for early stages in the infection process 9. S-S bonds has been observed between monomers of neighboring pentamers, at Cys 104 1.Early studies on SV40, performed by a number of groups, revealed that assembly occurred inside the nuclei, and consistently showed that it occurred by addition and organization of the capsomers around the viral minichromosome, rather than by incorporation of DNA into pre-formed capsids (for representative references see 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15). Importantly, empty SV40 particles present in standard virus stocks were demonstrated to be the dissociation products of immature virus rather than an intermediate in viral morphogenesis 13. Pulse-chase and velocity gradient sedimentation experiments indicated that viral morphogenesis proceeded via a series of intermediates: 100S replicating chromatin→75S intermediate→200S pre-virions→240S mature virions. The 75S nucleoprotein complex was found to rapidly convert to 200S pre-virions, with a full complement of capsid proteins. Assembly intermediates with partial capsids were only seen in studies with virions mutated in VP1 16, 17. Notable assembly intermediates also accumulated in virions with mutations at the amino-terminus of the T-antigen gene 18, in a region demonstrated to encode for the co-chaperone J-domain 19, supporting the requirement for chaperones. In addition, rearrangement of nucleosomes around the SV40 genome, driven by the capsid proteins, was shown to be a prerequisite for assembly 20, 21.All three capsid proteins were found to bind DNA nonspecifically 6, 22 at a high affinity. This raised the question how they recognize the viral minichromosome within the nucleus, in the presence of a large excess of cellular chromatin. Our studies indicated that specific recognition of the SV40 minichromosome is achieved via Sp1 bound at the SV40 encapsidation signal ses 23, 24. Sp1 is a 95 kDa mammalian transcription factor, containing a zinc finger protein motif, by which it binds directly to GC-motifs on the DNA and enhances gene transcription 25. In SV40 Sp1 binds to the GC-boxes, which are part of the encapsidation signal ses, within the regulatory region of the genome.Our genetic and biochemical studies indicated that Sp1 recruits the capsid proteins to the viral minichromosome, forming an Sp1-VP15VP2/3-ses recruitment complex 4, 26. Furthermore, we found that binding of the VP15VP2/3 complex to ses in the presence of Sp1 led to turnoff of both early and late genes 26, thus acting in regulating the transition from replication and transcription to assembly. Sp1 was not found in mature virions 27, indicating that before assembly it was displaced from the viral genome, facilitating nucleosomal reorganization and condensation of the minichromosome 20, 21.Icosahedral capsid assembly must be an efficient, high fidelity process. The final product is a topologically closed, stable sphere-like particle. Theoretical considerations, supported by experimental results on HBV capsid assembly, suggest that assembly is initiated by a nucleation center, in a slow, rate limiting step 28, 29. This ensures an extremely robust assembly reaction regardless of protein concentration, avoiding ‘kinetic traps’, which occur when there are too many assembly initiation events and insufficient level of free subunits to allow them to reach completion 30. In SV40, the Sp1-VP15VP2/3-ses recruitment complex (or multiple of those) that binds at a very high affinity to a specific site of the SV40 genome, ses, most likely also functions as the nucleation center for assembly. We propose that the 75S species, the only intermediate seen in the early in vivo assembly studies, which contains chromatin with a small amount of VP1 and VP2/3 15, 31, 32, represents the viral genome with the nucleation center attached.Our recent EM studies, using a VP1 mutant deleted in the C-arm that can bind DNA but cannot assemble, have shown that in vitro multiple capsomers bind around single DNA molecules at random locations 27. We have proposed that this occurs also in vivo, after the nucleation center is formed, increasing local capsomer concentration and facilitating rapid, concerted assembly reaction. We have further suggested that these additional capsomers bind at a lower affinity than the nucleation center, allowing their rearrangement around the minichromosome, as required for capsid geometry.Recombinant VP1 of polyomaviruses contain the information for self-assembly. VP1 of various members of the polyomaviradae family, produced in E. coli 33, 34 or in insect cells 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 spontaneously assembles into polymorphic virus-like particles (VLPs) of different sizes. Recently it has been demonstrated that adding chaperones to the assembly reaction leads to a high fidelity (albeit inefficient) assembly of particles of uniform size and shape 8.We previously reported that SV40 VLPs produced in insect cells were capable of incorporating plasmid DNA in a simple mixing reaction 40. We showed that intact supercoiled DNA molecules were packaged within the particles, that the particles were infectious and that the transmitted DNA was a biologically active in gene expression and replication. VP2 and VP3 did not enhance their assembly and/or infectivity, suggesting that the VP1 shell is sufficient for these functions. Here we have established an assembly reaction that more closely mimics the in vivo process, whereby capsomers assemble around DNA, under physiological conditions, in the presence of as yet unidentified host-cell factors. The results show very high cooperativity of VP1 in the reaction and support the model described above, in which multiple VP1 pentamers first bind to the DNA, which becomes compacted and serves as a scaffold for assembly."

            "introduction": "The widespread use of antiretroviral drugs has dramatically modified the natural history of HIV infection, causing a significant reduction in the HIV-associated mortality and morbidity. However, despite complete virologic suppression under treatment, many HIV-infected patients exhibit a persistent state of immune activation which leads to the development of a variety of inflammatory and metabolic pathologies (atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, cirrhosis, neurocognitive disorders, metabolic abnormalities) having a negative impact on the clinical progression of HIV infection 1. To prevent the onset of AIDS and non-AIDS related comorbidities, it is crucial to develop strategies of intervention capable of blocking HIV replication and down-regulating the state of chronic inflammation.The CCR5 antagonists are a new class of antiretroviral drugs used for the treatment of patients infected with R5-tropic virus 2, 3. Recent lines of evidence suggest that maraviroc (MVC), the only CCR5 antagonist approved for clinical use, has beneficial immunologic effects beyond its capacity to inhibit virus entry 4. This drug might have a potential role in the downregulation of HIV-associated chronic inflammation by blocking the recirculation and trafficking of leukocytes within the inflamed tissues.Leukocyte trafficking and local inflammation plays a prominent role in the physiopathology of HIV infection of the central nervous system (CNS) 5. Indeed, the development of HIV-associated neurological disorders is associated with increased migration of leukocytes into the CNS, which can disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and propagate neuroinflammation. These pathologic processes result in BBB permeability, glial activation, and neuronal compromise, all of which contribute to CNS damage 6. The entry of leukocytes into the CNS is dependent in several factors including the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 7.MMPs are a large family of zinc-containing endopeptidases that degrade extracellular matrix and basement membrane compounds (collagens, gelatin, laminin, fibronectin) 8. They share common structural domains, but differ with respect to their cellular sources, inducibility and efficiency of substrate utilization. The expression and the activity of MMPs are tightly regulated. Most of the regulatory mechanisms mediated by soluble factors occur primarily at the transcriptional level and involve phosphorilaton of serine-threonine kinases related to the mitogen-activated proteine kinase (MAPK) superfamily 9. Posttranscriptional regulation of MMPs includes their secretion as latent enzymes and proenzyme activation in the extracellular milieu by different proteinases. Inhibition of MMP activation and proteolytic activity in the extracellular milieu is controlled by a unique family of natural tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) which form with active MMPs stable, non-covalent enzyme-inhibitor complexes 10.There is evidence that an altered production and secretion of MMPs and TIMPs might be involved in the development of HIV-associated brain injury, contributing to breakdown of the BBB, spreading of HIV into CNS, degradation of myelin and induction of neuronal death 11, 12. Brain macrophages, microglia and astrocytes represent the candidate cells for the production of MMP within the CNS.In previous studies, we demonstrated that antiretroviral drugs inhibit MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion and expression in LPS-stimulated astrocytes and microglia 13. More recent data shows that antiretroviral compounds can also significantly downregulate the expression of MMP-9 in HIV-naturally infected mononuclear cells 14, indicating that antiretroviral drugs may mitigate MMP-mediated damage by mechanisms that are independent from their ability to block HIV replication. These findings may have great therapeutic implications, suggesting that MMPs may represent a potential target for the development of adjunctive strategies for the management of HIV infection, especially within CNS 12.On the basis of these observations, since the release of MMPs from glial cells may represent a key event in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated demyelination, we investigated whether CCR5 antagonist MVC was able to modulate the activity and/or the expression of gelatinases A (MMP-2) and B (MMP-9) released from glial cells. Our results indicated that MVC is able to dose-dependently inhibit the release and the expression of MMP-9 from PMA-activated astrocyte cell cultures."

In developing countries this is frequently compounded by low rates of immunisation, untreated co-morbidities, and late presentations 2. Febrile illnesses are caused by diverse pathogens, presenting with non-specific symptoms to healthcare facilities with limited diagnostic capacity 3, 4. Clinical management guidelines for acute febrile illness are available 5, 6, but rarely supported by knowledge of the locally prevalent causative agents.The Kingdom of Cambodia lies in South-East Asia and has a mortality rate in children aged <5 years of 54/1000 live births 7. This has halved over the last decade but remains one of the highest in the region. The prevalence of undernutrition in children <5 years of age (less than 2 SD of weight for age) is 28% 7. There is little published information on the causes of fever in Cambodian children.We characterised the causes of febrile illness in children in Cambodia.

In 2009 we published a systematic review including 33 HBV outbreaks which occurred in EU and USA healthcare settings (HCS) 2 and we found that the use of multi-patient lancing devices for capillary blood sampling was the second most frequent route of HBV transmission after multi-use drug vials; similar findings were also reported by a similar review published in the same year 3. In fact, the role of multi-patient lancing devices in HBV transmission has been inferred since early ‘90s 2, 4–6, however no study has ever provided biological evidence to link multi-patient lancing devices with HBV cross infection.During February 2007 3 cases of acute HBV infection occurred in a single Italian oncohematology unit over less than 2 months. On March 2007, the INMI-Lazzaro Spallanzani (INMI) epidemiology team was asked to investigate the event and, if epidemic cluster(s) were confirmed, to identify and remove potential causes. This report presents the results of the outbreak investigation, which provide molecular evidence to link the use of a single multi-patient lancing device to the transmission of HBV within the oncohematology unit. The report has been written according to the ORION statement 7."

            "introduction": "Despite decreasing prevalence, malaria is one of the most important infectious diseases worldwide. In 2010, approximately 1.24 million people died of malaria globally, the majority of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa, including 52000 people in Mozambique. Of these individuals, 47% were above five years of age, which is more than previously assumed 1. Malaria is meso-endemic in this country, with stable transmission of more than 95% due to Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) 2, 3. Mozambique has an estimated national human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) prevalence in adults of 15–49 years of age of 11.5% in general and of 22.5% in Maputo (2009), with one of the highest global incidences of co-infection with malaria and HIV 4, 5, 6.Several studies have suggested that people infected with HIV have more frequent and more severe episodes of malaria and vice versa, as parameters of HIV disease progression worsen in individuals during acute malaria episodes, with unknown long-term effects 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. While there is increased mortality in adults co-infected with malaria and HIV in areas with unstable malaria transmission, this phenomenon has not been established in areas with stable malaria transmission 13, 14, 15, 16.In the present study, we examined the impact of co-infection with HIV on (i) clinical manifestations and (ii) outcome in hospitalised adult patients in Maputo with P. falciparum malaria."

            "introduction": "Influenza, a negative-sense RNA orthomyxovirus, is one of the few diseases that is truly global in scale. It is responsible for approximately three to five million cases of severe acute respiratory illness and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths each year throughout the world 1. In 2009, the swift isolation of swine-origin H1N1 strain (S-OIV) from all continents within several weeks of onset reinforced the idea that influenza is a highly infectious agent circulating worldwide 2, 3.Although vaccination remains one of the most powerful ways of combating influenza, choosing a representative strain for vaccine composition poses a challenging problem. Due to the virus's high evolutionary rate, significant resources must be spent to update vaccines each year in order to match the dominant epitope of the season. Even with annual strain selection, major antigenic reassortment can obviate otherwise promising vaccine candidates, as occurred with the ‘Fujian/411/2002’-like H3N2 strain in 2003 4, 5. To prevent such vaccine failures, a solid understanding of the global spread of influenza must inform the design process. If reservoirs for new viral strains can be identified, surveillance in these areas can better optimize prediction of seasonal variants in seeded regions.Previous papers investigating the global circulation of H3N2, the major seasonal influenza subtype prior to pandemic H1N1, focused on transmission within and between climate zones. Important motivating factors for such analysis include increased aerosol transmission in cold and dry conditions, as well as increased indoor crowding and decreased host immunity in cold and wet conditions 6, 7. In the temperate zones, influenza exhibits distinct seasonality with flu-related cases spiking in the winter. However, several papers have confirmed the presence of viral diversity even between these epidemic peaks 8, 9, 10, suggesting two possible scenarios during the inter-epidemic period: either viral infections locally persist at a low level only to reemerge as the dominant strains of the epidemic season, or an outside source introduces new genetic diversity into temperate populations each year. Although a degree of local persistence may occur, phylogenetic analysis supports the latter scenario, with few direct links between strains of the same region but successive seasons 8, 9, 10.For a given temperate zone, these conclusions suggest the tropics or the opposite temperate zone as plausible external seeding regions. At first blush, northern-southern temperate oscillations seem credible. Each year, northern and southern temperate climates have alternating seasonal influenza epidemics, lasting from November to April, and May to September respectively 11. A possible mechanism of viral spread could involve transmission from the seasonal peak of one temperate zone into the season ebb of the other. On the other hand, specific epidemiological characteristics suggest a tropical origin for influenza. For example, although both climates share a similar yearly burden of mortality from influenza, the tropics do not possess the same consistent seasonal peaks during the winter months 9, 12, 13. With a constant, low-level circulation of viruses year-round, the tropics represent an ideal epicenter for the extended transmission of new viruses to the rest of the world 14, 15, 16.Several papers tracking H3N2 across continents have asserted that this tropical reservoir of influenza strains lies within East-Southeast Asia 12, 14, 17. Russell, et al. analyzed H3N2 data to identify regions of the world that are antigenically and genetically leading or trailing. They found that newly emerging strains appeared in E-SE Asia roughly 6–9 months earlier than in other parts of the world, while South America experienced delayed transmission of roughly 6–9 months following other parts of the world 8.However, such studies have been limited by several drawbacks. Most papers focus on H3N2 as a single entity, when in reality, it co-circulates with several other subtypes, the most important of which is seasonal H1N1 11. Although they possess different surface antigens, H3N2 and H1N1 share enough genetic similarity to display cross-immunity. As a result, seasonal H1N1 may demonstrate transmission patterns distinct from H3N2's 18, 19. Such codependence between different subtypes is exemplified by the pandemic years of 1957 and 1968, when H2N2 replaced preexisting H1N1 and H3N2 replaced preexisting H2N2, respectively 20, 21. Similarly, the antigenically different pandemic H1N1 strain of 2009 has largely overtaken previously circulating H1N1 and H3N2 22. During the years our dataset took place, evidence that H3N2 and H1N1 rarely co-dominate in a season further supports the idea of codependent dynamics 7.A second shortcoming stems from biases in the number of sequences from different regions and different seasons 8. Most isolates of H3N2 and H1N1 were sampled from North America, whereas Africa and South America have been largely neglected 23. Many sequences were obtained within the last 15 years, making reliable tracking over long periods of time problematic. On the level of climate zones, the number of temperate isolates far outstrips the tropics. Although hemagglutinin (HA), the HA1 domain, and neuraminidase (NA) have the most globally representative distributions of sequences, even these remain skewed (Figure S1, Figure S2).In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic model for tracking the spread of influenza that employs two strategies to eliminate regional and seasonal data bias. The first involves clustering isolates of high sequence similarity by region and season. Since we would expect highly similar sequences from the same time and location to be related, we considered seeding events between clusters to be of greater significance. Consideration of clusters rather than individual sequences nullifies the over-representation of a high number of isolates from a single region and season (Figure 1). As a second strategy for eliminating bias, we determined statistical significance of inter-cluster seeding events by modeling transmission as a binomial distribution with prior probabilities based on the proportion of sequences isolated before a given time point. To illustrate our methodology, Figure 2 depicts the 2003–2004 flu season, which was marked by failure to predict the dominant, tropically-derived Fujian/411/2002-like H3N2 strain. We identified a strong seeding pattern from the tropics to all three climate zones, supporting the effectiveness of our methodology.10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001005.g001Figure 1\nMethodology for spatiotemporal clustering.\n(A) We first ordered sequences from NCBI from earliest to latest. Starting with the most recent virus “Seq 1,” we worked backwards, tracing the most parsimonious evolutionary path of the virus until we reached the oldest sequence “Seq 10.” To accomplish this goal, we defined each virus's most likely ancestor to have the highest sequence similarity among all older viruses. (B) Contiguous sequences along the evolutionary path were clustered (grouped) together by common geography and season. (C) The process was repeated starting with the next most recent virus not yet included in the evolutionary path. (D) The cycle continued until all sequences were connected in a tree of clustered evolutionary paths.\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001005.g002Figure 2\nMethodology for determining significant seasons.\nAs an example, consider the 2003-04 flu season. After clustering, there were a total of 10 observed seeding events into the northern temperate zone: 1 from the north, 4 from the tropics, and 5 from the south. Up until that year, the skewed regional distribution of HA sequences included 541 (48.3%) northern temperate, 240 (21.4%) tropical, and 339 (30.2%) southern temperate isolates. Multiplying these percentages with the 10 observed seeding events yielded expected counts of 4.8, 2.1, and 3.0. Therefore, the number of seeding events from the north was less than expected, and from the tropics and the south, more than expected. Corresponding binomial p-values—0.986, 0.043, and 0.049, respectively—indicated that there were two statistically significant events, the most significant of which was transmission from the tropics into the northern temperate zone. Similar analysis for transmission into the tropics and the southern temperate showed that only the tropical zone was a significant seeder.\nWe applied this model to the H3N2 and H1N1 coding regions of HA and NA, the most antigenic proteins of the eight viral segments. Clustering H3N2 sequences confirmed previous findings that this strain originates in the tropics, specifically E-SE Asia, and seeds South America by way of North America last. Clustering H1N1 NA also revealed a similar pattern of circulation beginning in the tropics. However, similar H1N1 analysis by continent and country was not possible due to the absence of a larger number of countries in the dataset.Applying the same methodology to the H3N2 HA1 domain increased the geographic diversity enough to enable reconstruction of the global influenza network prior to the 2009 pandemic strain at a country level. Our results suggest a possible flu seeding hierarchy beginning in China and spreading throughout a highly interconnected E-SE Asian subnetwork. From there, viruses transmit to an Oceanic subnetwork dominated by interchange between Australia and New Zealand. Both subnetworks seed into the USA, which in turn seeds many countries, particularly in South America.Expanding upon the sink-source hypothesis of global influenza dynamics proposed by Rambaut, et al. 15, we applied techniques of graph theory to identify important source and sink regions in the global flu network. These techniques better describe the dynamic nature of influenza movement across the globe, as well as suggest different vaccination strategies to disrupt maximally viral flow around the world."

            "introduction": "Worldwide, an estimated 33.3 million people are infected with HIV-1, 60% in sub-Saharan Africa, where women account for the majority of those infected 1. Antiretroviral therapy (ART), through reducing HIV-1 plasma 2 and genital HIV-1 RNA concentrations 3, has been associated with >90% reduction in HIV-1 transmission in observational studies 4 and a recent trial of earlier ART initiation 5. However, only about half of HIV-1–infected adults qualify for ART initiation per current country guidelines, and only 37% of those qualifying for ART in Africa received treatment 1. Thus, new HIV-1 prevention strategies that will reduce HIV-1 risk for those not on ART remain an urgent need.Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common disorder characterized by changes in vaginal flora in which normally predominant Lactobacillus species are replaced by potential pathogens including Gardnerella vaginalis, genital Mycoplasma, and fastidious anaerobic bacteria 6,7. For unknown reasons, BV is considerably more common among women in sub-Saharan Africa and other resource-poor countries than in developed countries, affecting up to 55% of women in some studies 8–10. BV has been associated with a 60% increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition in women 11, and, among women with HIV-1, with higher HIV-1 concentrations in cervicovaginal fluids 12–14. Bacteria associated with BV can induce viral replication and shedding in the genital tract 15,16, which may lead to increased HIV-1 infectiousness for women with BV 17,18. However, to date, no study has examined whether BV increases the risk of female-to-male HIV-1 transmission. We hypothesized that HIV-1–infected women with BV have an increased risk of female-to-male HIV-1 transmission than women with normal vaginal flora. To answer this question, we prospectively studied a cohort of African heterosexual couples in which the female was HIV-1 seropositive and the male was HIV-1–seronegative who were enrolled in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of dually HIV-1 and herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2–seropositive heterosexual African adults, and their HIV-1–seronegative partners."

            "introduction": "Marine organisms serve as hosts for a diversity of parasites and pathogens. Mortalities affect not only the host population, but can cascade through ecosystems. Loss of biologically engineered habitats such as seagrass beds (Lewis 1933; Taylor 1933) and cascading trophic effects due to removal of consumers (Lessios 1988) can alter community structure.Understanding marine disease and the timing of outbreaks is increasingly important given escalating anthropogenic stressors affecting marine ecosystems. Humans directly affect community structure (e.g., overfishing Jackson et al. 2001; Myers and Worm 2003) and facilitate introduction of terrestrial pathogens to marine organisms (e.g., canine distemper virus in Antarctic seals Bengtson and Boveng 1991). Human-mediated climate change may also affect disease prevalence. A recent review predicts disease in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems could increase with future climate warming (Harvell et al. 2002).Previous literature reviews suggesting a higher rate of disease outbreaks in the last three decades (Epstein et al. 1998; Harvell et al. 1999), coupled with predictions of future increases due to climate change (Harvell et al. 2002), lend new urgency to understanding causes of marine disease outbreaks. Evidence suggests the increase is real (Harvell et al. 1999), yet lack of baseline data for most marine communities precludes a direct test of the hypothesis.We developed a proxy method to test a prediction of the increasing disease hypothesis: that reports of disease in the scientific literature, normalized to overall publication rates, increased since 1970. We searched an online literature database (ISI Web of Science) and quantified reports of disease in natural populations of marine organisms from 1970 to 2001. Nine marine taxonomic groups were searched: turtles, corals, mammals, urchins, molluscs, seagrasses, deca-pods, sharks/rays, and fishes.Previous analyses of ecological literature specifically assessed trends among scientists such as taxonomic bias (Clark and May 2002) and taxonomic chauvinism (Bonnet et al. 2002) in research. Our proxy method is to our knowledge the first quantitative use of normalized trends in the literature to investigate an ecological hypothesis. In the absence of baseline data, the literature proxy method detects important trends of disease in major groups of marine plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates."

            "introduction": "Liver biopsy is often recommended in patients with unexplained elevated serum aminotransferases in order to determine the cause, to stage hepatic fibrosis and to grade hepatic inflammation. Non-invasive methods that can evaluate disease severity and the likelihood of disease progression in persons with elevated liver enzymes need to be developed. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that control translation and transcription of many genes. They are receiving growing attention because of numerous reports on their dysregulation in human diseases and their potential as diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Because of their stability and presence in almost all body fluids, miRNAs constitute a novel class of non-invasive biomarkers. Numerous studies have shown that aberrant miRNA expression is associated with the development and progression of various types of human cancer and therefore studies on circulating miRNA profiles largely focused on cancer 1–3.This study examined whether serum levels of selected miRNAs, thought to be deregulated in liver disease, can serve as non-invasive biomarkers of diagnosis and histological severity in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The highly abundant liver-specific miR-122, is of particular interest. miR-122 is known to regulate metabolic pathways in the liver, including cholesterol biosynthesis 4–7. miR-122 also positively regulates hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and viral production 8–10. Reduced expression of miR-122 has been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), often in advanced tumors of poor prognosis 11–13 although an upregulation of miR-122 was also reported in HCV-derived HCC 11, 14. miRNAs encoded by the miR-15/16 cluster act as tumor suppressors and are down-regulated in several human cancers 15. In contrast, miR-21 was identified to be consistently upregulated in many cancers 16 including HCC 17. Upregulation of miR-21 was also found in highly fibrotic HCV-infected human livers 18. miR-34a, a central mediator of p53 function 19, has recently emerged as another miRNA modulated in liver disease. Interestingly, while most studies report a downregulation of miR-34a in human cancers 19, miR-34a was found increased in HCC 17 as well as in a mouse model of steatohepatitis 20. We selected these four miRNAs (miR-122, miR-16, miR-21 and miR-34a) for the present study aimed at investigating their levels in serum of patients with CHC and NAFLD with a wide spectrum of histological disease severity. In addition to this analysis on human sera, we used an in vitro model of HCV infection to measure extracellular levels of these same miRNAs in supernatant of HCV-infected cells."

Without any intervention, mortality of HIV infected children can reach up to 35% before the first birthday and up to 52% before the second birthday 1, 2, and the untreated survivors would need substantial care 3. However early antiretroviral treatment routinely started before 12 weeks of age significantly increases infant survival by 76%, reduces morbidity and enhances immunological benefits 4, 5, 6, 7. The 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) revised guidelines recommend early antiretroviral treatment in all HIV infected children less than two years of age, regardless of their immune status 8. These guidelines also recommend a routine Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) from six-weeks of age of all HIV-exposed children. EID requires sophisticated technology before 18 months of age because of the persistence of maternal antibodies in infants 9. In addition, the uptake at each step in the EID cascade highlights that even with the highest reported level of uptake, nearly half of HIV-infected infants may not successfully complete the cumulative cascade 10. In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-exposed infants continue to suffer from insufficient access to EID and antiretroviral therapy. In 2010, a survey was conducted in Burkina Faso, Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire, to identify the major challenges regarding HIV prophylaxis for children in West Africa 11. The results of this survey indicated that only a small proportion of HIV-exposed newborns received antiretroviral prophylaxis. Scaling-up management of early pediatric HIV infection remains challenging in West African countries in 2011. But there is a need to increase the PMTCT coverage and to trace the children born in the setting of the PMTCT programs 12. It is crucial to identify the barriers at the national level. Burkina Faso is a West-African developing country where HIV prevalence was about 1.0% in 2010 13. HIV EID in children born to HIV-infected mothers is organized in cascade from the district health care facilities, towards district hospital laboratories, to the university hospital laboratories. There are few data on the full PMTCT cascade coverage and postnatal services in regard to infants born to HIV-infected mothers. Problems are related to resource management, and lack of assessment of sites.We described the access to pediatric HIV diagnosis and care in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso. We also assessed the health care facilities regarding the conformance of staff and infrastructures with WHO standards for the care of HIV infected infants in Ouagadougou in 2010–2011."

            "introduction": "Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is classified as a neoplastic proliferation with features of histiocytes/macrophages1. HS has also been called true histiocytic lymphoma or malignant histiocytosis, but these terms have been discontinued. Before 1990, the majority of patients diagnosed with HS were misdiagnosed due to a lack of antibodies specific for the histiocytic lineage. Retrospective analysis indicated the majority of these patients actually had B- or T-cell lymphomas2–5. Case studies have demonstrated that HS can occur in isolation or in the context of other hematological malignancies, such as B-cell lymphoma, to which the HS is sometimes clonally related4. HS may thus, in some cases, develop via trans-differentiation from a malignant, or premalignant, lymphoid neoplasm. HS is rare, with an incidence far less common than the non-Hodgkin lymphomas1, 6. Typically, patients present with advanced clinical disease and have a poor prognosis1, 4, 5. Since the genetic etiology of HS is largely unknown, HS is difficult to manage clinically and there is no standard therapy for patients with HS.Currently, no precursor lesions or etiologic agents have been described for human HS7. Two cytogenetic case studies identified gains in chromosome 8 in human HS8, 9, implicating MYC as a HS oncogene. Animal models have identified possible driver genetic lesions. ArrayCGH performed on over 100 canine HS samples revealed an average of 30 copy number alterations per tumor10, while a genome wide association study in Bernese Mountain Dogs identified a strong association between HS and the MTAP-CDKN2A locus11. Pten and Ink4aARF are also implicated, as compound heterozygous mice develop HS and 60% of human HS examined for protein expression show a loss of PTEN, p16INK4A, or p14ARF12. Several other genetic mouse models have produced HS including Dok1/Dok2/Dok3 triple knockout animals13, Cyp1b1 knockout mice14, p21 knockout mice15, and p19ARF/Bax mutant mice16. In addition, 50% of Cdkn2a deficient mice infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus developed HS, which was frequently accompanied by lymphoma17.To identify genetic drivers of HS we performed an unbiased forward genetic screen in mice using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon as an insertional mutagen18–20. SB is capable of both activating proto-oncogenes and inactivating tumor suppressor genes and has been used to identify genetic drivers in a variety of cancers21–32. In this study we activated SB mutagenesis using the Lysozyme2 (Lyz2) promoter in a cohort of mice resulting in early mortality and a large percentage of mice developing HS. Analysis of transposon CISs identified 28 genes, including 2 miRNAs associated with HS. Several of these genes are known oncogenes and tumor suppressors including Nf1, Pten, Myc and Fli1, while many others have not been directly associated with cancer and could be potential targets for therapy."

            "introduction": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was a new respiratory illness that emerged in China in 2003 and spread globally 1, 2. The causative agent was identified as a new coronavirus and was named SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3–5. The SARS-CoV genome consists of approximately 29,700 nucleotides encoding 28 putative proteins 6, 7. Just like other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV genome also contains several small open reading frames (ORFs) in addition to those encoding for structural proteins 6–9. These small ORFs are presumed to encode 8 group specific, accessory proteins viz. ORF3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b 8.One of these accessory proteins, the 9b protein is encoded by ORF-9b of the SARS-CoV genome. Just like the internal (I) gene of other group II coronaviruses, the ORF-9b of SARS-CoV overlaps with its nucleocapsid ORF 8, 10–12. However, there is no homology between the SARS-CoV 9b and I protein of other coronaviruses. The 9b protein has been shown to get expressed in SARS-CoV-infected cells and antibodies against it have been found in the sera of SARS infected patients, demonstrating that the protein is produced during infection 13–16, but its actual function is not yet determined. Studies on 9b-structure by Meier et al., (2006) revealed a 2-fold symmetric dimer having a lipid binding cavity and proposed its role in virus assembly 17. Cellular localization of 9b has been previously reported to be predominantly cytoplasmic and membranous. Also, a nuclear export signal (NES) present in its 46-LRLGSQLSL-54 amino acid region has been suggested to be responsible for its nucleocytoplasmic export 18.Keeping this in mind, we studied the cellular localization pattern of 9b and found that in addition to the cytoplasm, some of the 9b protein was also present in the nucleus. This entry of 9b into the nucleus was independent of cell cycle progression. Further, we showed that 9b which lacks the nuclear localization signal (NLS) continued to enter the nucleus passively and was able to exit the nucleus due to its functional NES. Also, nuclear export was found to be Crm-1 dependent and blocking NES based export resulted in an increased half-life of 9b, which accumulated in the nucleus. Finally, our studies revealed that when 9b remained within the nucleus, it triggered caspase 3 mediated apoptosis in transiently transfected mammalian cells. The requirement for caspase 3 in apoptosis induction was further confirmed using the cell permeant caspase inhibitors, Z-VAD-FMK (general caspase inhibitor) and Z-DEVD-FMK (caspase 3 inhibitor). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing the nuclear localization of 9b, its passive diffusion into and active Crm-1 dependent transport out of the nucleus. Also, this is the first report associating 9b with nucleocytoplasmic export linked apoptosis."

            "introduction": "Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile fragments of DNA that can accumulate and occupy large fractions of a genome, including over 45% of the human genome 1. When active, TEs have the potential to create mutations by inserting into genes or generating breaks in DNA. To suppress the mutagenic potential of TEs, the eukaryotic genome has evolved defense mechanisms to inhibit TE proliferation, which are distinct from the developmental regulation of genes 2. TEs are targeted for epigenetic repression mediated by the overlapping signals of cytosine DNA methylation, repressive histone tail modifications, and remodeling of chromatin into transcriptionally recalcitrant condensed heterochromatin (reviewed in 3). Gene regulation can be influenced by the epigenetic regulation of TEs; however, this only occurs due to the proximity of a preexisting or newly transposed TE to a gene. This regulation of genes by neighboring TEs in cis can be due to multiple mechanisms, including interruption of a regulatory element, or by local spreading of repressive chromatin modifications such as DNA or histone methylation, resulting in position-effect variegation and potentially the formation of heritable epialleles 4–5.TEs are major producers of small RNAs that act to maintain the TE in an epigenetically silenced state. In plants, and perhaps in animals, heterochromatin modifications are targeted by the activity of small RNAs. For example, in the mouse TE-derived piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) guide DNA methylation to TEs 6. In the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the cycle of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is initiated by the plant-specific RNA Polymerase IV (PolIV), which produces a non-protein coding transcript that is converted into double stranded RNA (dsRNA) by the activity of RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase 2 (RDR2)(reviewed in 7). Dicer-like 3 (DCL3) cleaves this TE dsRNA into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of 24 nucleotides (nt) in length, which are incorporated into either Argonaute 4 (AGO4), AGO6, or potentially AGO9 8. These siRNA-loaded Argonaute proteins act to maintain the heterochromatic state of TEs by targeting them for DNA and histone tail methylation.Athila LTR retrotransposons are the largest family of TEs in Arabidopsis, occupying over 2.7% of the genome 9. Athila elements are transcriptionally silenced, and silencing is dependent on symmetrical CG DNA methylation. When DNA methylation is removed, either in a DNMT1-homolog maintenance of DNA methylation 1 (met1) mutant, or in a swi/snf family chromatin remodeling protein decrease in DNA methylation 1 (ddm1) mutant, transcriptional activation occurs 10–11. Athila retrotransposons are also transcriptionally activated in the vegetative nucleus of wild-type (wt) pollen grains 12. In all of these examples heterochromatin modifications and condensation are lost, and global activation of TEs occurs 4, 12–13.Upon global activation of TEs, there are widespread shifts in the accumulation of small RNAs derived from TE transcripts. Transcriptional activation of most silenced TEs results in the loss of their corresponding siRNAs 12–14. However, some retrotransposon families, including Athila, are unusual in the fact that they produce more siRNAs when epigenetically active than when epigenetically silenced 12, 15–16. The Athila siRNAs that increase in abundance are primarily 21–22 nt in length and are produced from the non-protein coding region downstream of the gag and pol ORFs of the consensus Athila element. The abundance and specific location of these siRNAs generates islands of 21–22 nt siRNAs in the genome when epigenetic silencing of Athila is lost 12.In Arabidopsis, as well as in animals, the production of small RNAs and subsequent targeting of TEs is distinct from the production of gene-regulating small RNAs (reviewed in 17). The first examples of a TE piRNA or siRNA regulating a genic mRNA in trans were only recently discovered in Drosophila and mouse 18–19. In addition, recently an example of a plant viral siRNA was shown to regulate a gene 20. However, these examples represent exceptions to the general rule of separation between TE/viral and gene-regulating small RNAs 21. For example, there is a clear distinction between the biogenesis mechanism and target of TE siRNAs and microRNAs. MicroRNAs act in plants and animals to regulate gene expression on the post-transcriptional or translational level. In Arabidopsis, DCL1 produces 21 nt microRNAs from stem-loop precursor transcripts generated by RNA polymerase II (PolII), and these microRNAs are loaded primarily into AGO1. Thus, microRNAs are not amplified by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and only one or two single small RNA species accumulate from the microRNA locus. In contrast, most plant siRNAs are the products of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, and cleavage of these long dsRNAs produces clusters of siRNAs from each locus. However, the notion that only microRNAs regulate genes, while endogenous siRNAs do not, is incorrect, as some inverted repeat-derived siRNAs act to regulate genes, 22 and other siRNAs act to regulate genes through the trans-acting siRNA (tasiRNA) pathway in Arabidopsis. This pathway begins with the cleavage of a non-protein coding transcript by the microRNA-loaded AGO1 or AGO7, which initiates the DCL4- and RDR6-dependent phased production of siRNAs (reviewed in 23). These siRNAs are loaded into AGO1 and regulate gene expression similar to a microRNA. DCL4, RDR6 and AGO1, as well as DCL2, also act on viral transcripts in the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) pathway to initiate and amplify the 21–22 nt siRNA signal that participates in the post-transcriptional degradation of the viral mRNAs, as well as to transport these siRNAs to unaffected regions of the plant to mount a systemic resistance to the spread of the virus 24–28. Therefore, the Arabidopsis AGO1 protein is highly versatile, as it is involved in the microRNA, tasiRNA and VIGS pathways. It is currently unknown if, how or why AGO1 distinguishes between a gene-regulating tasiRNA and a VIGS siRNA involved in viral transcript processing, as both are generated using the same DCL4 and RDR6 machinery.Arteaga-Vázquez et al demonstrated that 12 elements of the Athila6 subfamily each encode a small RNA, for which they predicted and provided indirect evidence targets a genic transcript for translational repression 29. They predicted that this small RNA was generated as a microRNA from a stem-loop precursor transcript and determined that it was processed by the microRNA machinery DCL1, HEN1 and HYL1. Additionally, they predicted that this microRNA, which they named microRNA854, targets the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the UPB1b gene, a homolog of the mammalian TIA-1 that encodes an RNA binding protein involved in the formation of stress granules 30–31. They observed that 21 nt microRNA854 accumulates in wt vegetative tissues and found that the microRNA854-targeted UPB1b 3′UTR inhibits translation in wt plants when the 3′UTR is added to a reporter transcript. Lastly, Arteaga-Vázquez et al provided evidence that microRNA854 is highly conserved from plants to mammals.We were unable to detect the accumulation of 21 nt microRNA854 in wt seedling, root, leaf and inflorescence tissues. Due to the failure to meet multiple criteria in order to validate this small RNA as a microRNA 32, including the biogenesis pathway of this small RNA (see below), we have renamed this small RNA siRNA854 to avoid confusion. We have directly demonstrated that the TE-derived siRNA854 regulates in trans the transcript of the UBP1b gene. We show that the accumulation of siRNA854 is under the same trans-generational epigenetic regulation and inheritance patterns to which Athila TEs are subject. Upon Athila6 epigenetic activation, siRNA854 production is shifted from a 24 nt TE siRNA dependent on PolIV and RDR2, to 21–22 nt siRNAs that are dependent upon DCL2, DCL4 and RDR6 and are incorporated into AGO1. We demonstrate that UBP1b regulation is altered only when Athila6 is epigenetically activated, resulting in the phenocopy of the stress-sensitive upb1b mutant phenotype."

            "introduction": "Recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) are attractive candidates for vaccine design because, while they resemble native virions in size and morphology, they are non-infectious due to the absence of a viral genome. VLP surface structure can be engineered and optimized to achieve an enhanced immune response due to the multiplicity of repetitive surface epitopes that mimic the authentic surface features of native virions 1. Since its initial introduction (Table S1), the VLP approach has been extended to include production in a variety of cell culture systems; recombinant technology has successfully been used to produce VLPs as vaccines 2, 3 and as epitope presentation vehicles for HIV (gp41) 4 and malaria 5.Non-infectious VLPs derived from Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and composed of the small HBV derived surface antigen (HBsAg) were described over 40 years ago 6, 7. HBsAg VLPs are 22 nm spherical lipid-protein particles 6, 7 composed of three envelope proteins 8, that produce a strong protective immune response 9. The envelope proteins result from variations in post translational proteolytic processing of the HBV S gene protein product and are termed the small (S), medium (M), and large (L) form of HBsAg, or the S protein 10. Non-infectious VLPs self-assembled from these proteins and lipid were used for the development of the first VLP-based vaccine and, a few years later, recombinant DNA technology was employed to make the first recombinant protein based vaccine with only the S form of HBsAg (226 aa) 11.HBsAg VLPs induce a protective immune response by mimicking the surface features of native HBV virions by including multiple and repetitive epitopes. Well-defined epitope structure and less protein conformation flexibility are important for binding to neutralization antibodies in vitro (antigenicity) and in eliciting neutralizing antibodies in vivo (immunogenicity) for the vaccine particles 12, 13. The immunogenic epitope of HBV recognized by neutralizing antibody RF1 is composed of a stretch of 14 amino acid residues, 8 of which are cysteines. Refinement of epitope structure, a process known as maturation via disulfide bond formation and exchange at these cysteine residues during purification or storage over time 1, 14, 15, 16, 17, has been previously linked to subviral particle antigenic and immunogenic properties 12, 14. In order to ensure recombinant vaccine safety and efficacy, it is vital to facilitate the development and maintenance of these native virion-like epitopes on the VLP surface 3, 18 in a manner that enhances VLP stability during protein expression, purification, and formulation. This requires an in-depth understanding of VLP epitope structure and function.Although hundreds of millions of patients have been immunized by the recombinant HBsAg VLP based HBV vaccines since the initial introduction for human use in 1986, a definitive understanding of the HBsAg VLP structure and the key antigenic features is still lacking. Characterization efforts have been hampered by the conformational heterogeneity inherent in a lipid-protein particle with 75% protein and ∼25% lipid, the important role of disulfide bond formation for epitope structure and function of this cysteine-rich VLP, and the presence of the S, M, and L forms of the HBsAg protein in early preparations 19, 20, 21. In addition, traditional structural and antigenicity characterization methods are prone to artifacts resulting from sample processing steps (Table 1).10.1371/journal.pone.0033235.t001Table 1\n          Non-intrusive biophysical and immunochemical methods evaluated here for VLP characterization compared with conventional techniques.\n        \n          \n            \n            \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n              Conventional Method\n              Non-intrusive Toolbox\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)\n              \n              \n                TEM with Negative Stain Sample Preparation\n              \n              \n                Cryo-TEM with Vitrified Sample Preparation\n              \n            \n            \n              \n              - Adsorption to surface of grid can cause particle deformation and aggregation\n              - No adsorption to surface\n            \n            \n              \n              - Washing steps can change sample buffer conditions\n              - No washing steps\n            \n            \n              \n              - Heavy metal stain can cause particle deformation and dehydration\n              - No heavy metal stain;

This method is used to probe the stability samples upon prolonged storage in a more faithful manner as to the intact and accessible epitopes. In addition, this method may also mimic the in vivo antigen presentation to some degree without the needs to dissolve the aluminum adjuvant, which is co-injected with antigen during immunization.\n          \n        Structural methods, such as negative stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or atomic force microscopy (AFM) on surface immobilized VLPs, require sample adsorption to a surface, washing steps, and additives that can result in particle dehydration, aggregation, and deformation. More widely accepted antigenicity characterization methods, such as animal based mouse potency assays, radio-labeled immuno assays (RIA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), suffer from an indirect correlation between signal and antigen content due to requirements for secondary labels, signal amplification, or presence of multiple epitopes 12, 13. Furthermore, these methods also require washing steps, sample adsorption to surfaces, and adjuvant dissolution, which can lead to sample dehydration and deformation. The potential for artifact introduction during sample processing by these traditional structural and functional characterization tools complicate data interpretation, as there is not a true correlation between native epitope structure and measurement.Recent developments in non-intrusive biophysical and immunochemical methods that allow analysis of samples in their native state provide the potential for direct measurement and understanding of epitope structure and function 14, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) directly and rapidly monitors antigenicity development during epitope refinement in real time without the requirement of a label, where the signal is proportional to the mass deposited onto the sensor chip surface during biomolecular interactions 23. An optimized solution competitive ELISA, performed with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets clinically relevant epitopes 23, quantitatively tracks the development of virion-like epitopes on VLPs in solution or when bound to particulate aluminum-based adjuvant. CryoTEM allows determination of the native, hydrated structure of VLPs 24, 25, and in-solution AFM visualizes VLP surface features without particle deformation or drying 14, 22, 26. Here, we have evaluated the use of these biophysical and immunochemical methods in concert as a potential novel suite of non-intrusive VLP characterization tools by applying them to the characterization of the VLP-based vaccine against HBV 11."

            "introduction": "The orosomucoid 1-like 3 (ORMDL3) gene, which belongs to a novel evolutionarily conserved gene family (ORMDL1-3), encodes a protein locate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane 1. It has been well established by a series of independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that ORMDL3 is a risk factor for the development of many immune-related diseases, e.g. asthma, recurrent wheeze, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Among these diseases, the relationship between ORMDL3 and asthma is best established: 1) the relationship between asthma risk alleles on 17q21 locus and ORMDL3 mRNA level is strong, and already exist in cord blood 8; 2) changed transcript level of ORMDL3 is found in Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from children with asthma 2; 3) ORMDL3 expression can be significantly induced by allergen in airway epithelial cells of mice 9; 4) the induction of ORMDL3 high expression in normal human lung fibroblasts by polyinosine-polycytidylic acid indicates the role ORMDL3 may play in viral respiratory infection 10, 11, a pathological state believed to induce and exacerbate asthma 12; 5) transcript level of ORMDL3 in children with recurrent wheeze is higher than in normal children 13.As orthologues of the yeast Orm proteins (Orm1/2), which are regulators of sphingolipid biosynthesis, the mammalian ORMDL proteins (ORMDL1/2/3) play a relevant role in maintaining the sphingolipid homeostasis. It has been reported that all the three isoforms of ORMDL proteins take part in the modulation of ceramide synthesis by directly and negatively regulating serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) activity, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in sphingolipid production 14. Several studies support a role for sphingolipids such as ceramide in asthma-associated inflammatory processes, including mast cell degranulation, airway hyper-responsiveness and immune-cell trafficking 15. Besides, as an ER-resident transmembrane protein, ORMDL3 alters ER-mediated Ca+ homeostasis and facilitates the unfolded-protein response (UPR), a process considered as an endogenous inducer of inﬂammation, by interacting with the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca+ pump (SERCA) 16. The above two biological function of ORMDL3 raise the testable hypothesis that misregulation of ORMDL3 may play a causative role in the development of asthma and other ORMDL3 associated diseases partly through effecting the sphingolipid homeostasis and ER homeostasis. Elucidating the molecular mechanism that control transcription of ORMDL3 gene may yield insights into the mechanism how misregulation of ORMDL3 leads to the pathology of asthma.Prior studies revealed that both human and mouse express the same three ORMDL family members with ORMDL3 exhibiting 96% identity between man and mouse 1. Nevertheless, the transcriptional regulation mechanisms of different species of the same gene may not be alike. Our group has recently reported that transcriptional activity of human ORMDL3 gene was cooperatively regulated by transcription factors Ets-1, p300 and CREB through binding to the promoter of ORMDL3 gene 13. Here, we explore the regulation mechanism of mouse ORMDL3 (mORMDL3) gene in the NIH3T3 system, and find that there are differences between human and mouse ORMDL3 gene expression regulation mechanisms. Furthermore, signaling pathway cAMP/PKA/CREB plays an important role in regulating ORMDL3 expression."

            "introduction": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronically infects ∼170 million people worldwide and ∼3.1 million people in the US 1, 2. Chronic HCV infection can cause chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 3. Treatment with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin leads to a sustained virological response (SVR) in ∼50% of patients infected with HCV genotype 1 with 48 weeks of therapy and ∼80% of patients infected with HCV genotype 2 or 3 with a 24-week course 4–6.It has recently been reported that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 19q13 region, in close proximity to three genes (IL28A, IL28B and IL29) encoding cytokines of the interferon lambda (i.e. type III interferon) family are strongly associated with the treatment response to peginterferon alfa and ribavirin among HCV genotype 1-infected individuals 7–10. One of these SNPs, rs8099917, is reportedly highly predictive of a favorable treatment response among patients infected with Japanese HCV genotype 1. Null responsiveness to interferon was used in the analysis that endorsed rs8099917 8.Interferon lambda utilizes a receptor complex different from interferon alfa, but both types of interferon induce signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2, as well as STAT3 activation 11. Activation of the interferon receptor leads to at least one cytoplasm Janus tyrosine protein kinase (Jak1). Interferon stimulation results in tyrosine phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear import of STATs 12. STATs and the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) transcription factor complex moves into the nucleus, binds to interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) in the promoters of the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like 2′, 5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) genes, and induces transcription of those genes. Gene expression array analysis showed that interferons alfa and lambda induced a similar subset of genes although interferon lambda signaling was observed for more restricted cell lines. Interferon lambda has been shown to be induced after stimulation with several single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses 13. There was a report that the antiviral activity of type III interferon surpassed that of type I interferon 14. There are several reports concerning HCV interfering with the Jak/STAT signaling pathway 15, 16.As shown previously, nonresponders had high expression levels of ISGs before therapy 17. Sarasin-Filipowicz et al. 18 reported that phospholyration, DNA binding, and nuclear localization of STAT1 were pre-activated and refractory to further stimulation in nonresponsive patients. Several recent studies suggested that the expressions of ISGs in liver 19 and plasma 20 are associated with genetic variation in IL28B and the outcome of interferon therapy for chronic hepatitis C. The expression of hepatic ISGs is strongly associated with treatment response and genetic variation of IL28B 19. The favorable IL28B SNP variants are also associated with lower baseline interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10 kDa (IP-10 or CXCL10) 20.The impact of STAT1 on the elimination of HCV RNA during therapy in the setting of IL28B genetic variants is unknown. We therefore assessed the nuclear translocation of STAT1 in pre-treatment liver biopsies and IL28B rs8099917 in patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 1. We also correlated the biochemical data with the treatment response, and all resulting data were analyzed."

            "introduction": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders in which both failure to differentiate and overproliferation in the stem cell compartment lead to accumulation of non-functional cells termed myeloblasts 1. The primary objective in treating patients with AML is to induce a complete remission and thereafter prevent relapse. Recently, though high-dose induction treatment plus allogeneic stem cell transplantation can acquire a high rate of complete remission, 5-year overall survival rate of patients with AML was about 30% 2, 3. Incomplete eradication of leukemic stem cells which express the CD34 antigen and concomitantly lack lineage-associated markers (CD34+lin−) may ultimately contribute to relapse. Therefore, alternative treatments still need to be found for patients with AML.Some natural products have been used as alternative treatments for cancers including AML because of their extensive biological activities and comparatively low toxicities 4, 5. Matrine, an alkaloid extracted from Sophora flavescens Aif, is quinolizidine with four-loop and molecular formula of C15H24N20. Matrine has been found to exhibit many biological activities, such as anti-inflammation, anti-virus, anti-fibrosis, anti-arrhythmia, and immunosuppression, leading to wide clinical use in the treatment of viral hepatitis, liver fibrosis, heart arrhythmia and skin diseases in China 6–11. Recently, intensive studies have shown that matrine possesses potent antitumor activities by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of cells from gastric cancer, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, melanoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma 12–21. In addition, matrine can also induce the differentiation of leukemia K562 cells 20, the migration of lung cancer A549 cells 15, or the invasion of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells 17. Key mechanisms proposed for the antitumor effects of matrine include regulating the expression of proliferation- and apoptosis-related genes or proteins, such as eIF4E, E2F-1, Fas, FasL, Bcl-2, Bax, and caspases 12–21. We have previously shown that matrine triggers apoptosis of human multiple myeloma cells via activation of the mitochondrial pathway 21. Liu et al 19 demonstrated that matrine induced apoptosis in U937 cells via caspases activation and MAPK-independent pathways. However, the systematic scientific evaluation and its anticancer mechanisms on AML cell lines as well as primary AML cells remain elusive.In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of matrine on AML cell lines HL-60, NB4, and U937 as well as primary AML cells obtained from patients with AML and its underlying mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. We found that matrine could induce apoptosis of AML cells by collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), release of cytochrome c (cyt c) from mitochondria to cytosol, reduction of the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, activation of caspase-3, and down-regulation of p-Akt and p-ERK1/2.\n        10.1371/journal.pone.0046853.g001\n        Figure 1\n        \n          Effects of matrine on proliferation of AML cells, leukemic CD34+lin− cells and normal CD34+lin− cells.\n          AML cell lines (HL-60, NB4, and U937), primary AML cells (BMMNCs), leukemic CD34+lin− cells, and normal CD34+lin− cells were treated with various concentrations of matrine for 12 h, 24 h and 48 h.

            "introduction": "Respiratory viruses are associated with the majority of asthma exacerbations, which are a major cause of disease morbidity. Asthmatics do not appear to have more frequent viral infections than healthy individuals, but instead suffer more persistent and severe lower respiratory tract symptoms 1, 2; human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are the most commonly identified in older children and adults. Given the importance of HRV in asthma and the paucity of effective anti-viral therapeutic options, a better understanding of the immune and inflammatory response to HRV is a significant focus of current respiratory research.In response to HRV infection in vitro, a number of reports indicate that airway epithelial cells from people with asthma have a reduced capacity for innate interferon (IFN) synthesis, relative to normal airway epithelial cells 3, 4. Deficient gene expression and/or synthesis of IFNα, IFNβ and IFNλ in epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages have been described in asthma 3, 4, although these findings have not been confirmed by some investigators 5, 6.During acute infection it is a well-established paradigm that affected tissue sites signal the bone marrow and central lymphoid organs to recruit the immune cell populations required for pathogen neutralization. This process goes beyond mere chemo-attraction, and can include functional programming of migratory myeloid and lymphoid precursors within the bone marrow, prior to their arrival at mucosal surfaces 7. These migratory immune cells represent an important reservoir during acute infection that supplements host defence provided by resident lung leukocytes. It is noteworthy in this regard that dysregulated anti-viral immune responses have been demonstrated in circulating populations of innate/adaptive immune cells in asthma 8. PBMC from asthmatic children and adults secrete less IFNα following in vitro exposure to viruses 9, 10, which is associated with reduced function of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-7, a key receptor for single stranded viral RNA 11; TLR3 function appears to be equivalent in asthmatic and healthy individuals. Notably, other investigators report that HRV-activated PBMC from people with mild or well controlled asthma exhibit normal function in vitro 12.As plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are a potent source of type-I IFN synthesis during virus infections 13, some researchers have examined the role of pDC in asthma (recently reviewed 14). Numerical changes in circulating pDC have been linked both to asthma development in young children 15 and to established asthma in adults 16. The function of pDC also appears to be abnormal in asthma, with reports demonstrating that pDC from allergic asthmatics are less able to synthesise IFNα in response to influenza A 17 or TLR9 activation 18 than pDC from healthy subjects.Little progress has been made in defining the detailed mechanisms by which HRV induces an innate immune response in migratory leukocytes, and which of these mechanisms are altered in asthma. Accordingly, the current study examined various processes associated with HRV stimulated IFN production, including recognition of viral RNA by TLRs, signalling pathways associated with the induction of IFNα and IFNβ gene expression, and molecules linked to viral entry. These data provide evidence that allergic asthma is associated with multiple alterations in anti-viral innate interferon signalling pathways. This appears to involve abnormalities in the regulation of TLR7, TLR8, interferon regulatory factors and pDC."

            "introduction": "The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) pandemic is one of the greatest challenges facing tuberculosis (TB) control. Immune suppression increases the risk of reactivation of latent TB infection and rapid progression to active TB disease 1. TB diagnosis is more difficult in people living with HIV infection and initiation of HIV treatment can paradoxically worsen TB by restoring immune function 2. The effects of HIV on TB result in a strong correlation between HIV prevalence and TB incidence rates 3. Overall, an estimated 8% of new TB cases are attributable to HIV co-infection 4. The TB incidence rate and HIV prevalence among new TB cases is highest in sub-Saharan Africa. The leading cause of death among HIV infected patients in the developing world is TB. An estimated 13% of the 1.5 million TB deaths in 2006 were attributed to HIV infection, but in the African region this proportion has been much higher 3. The risk of death in co-infected patients is twice that of HIV–infected individuals without TB, even when CD4+ cell count and antiretroviral therapy are taken into account 5.Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, further threatens TB control because of high treatment failure and death rates, and complexities in diagnosis and treatment. MDR-TB can be a result of failure of drug sensitive TB treatment with development of resistance (acquired MDR-TB) or direct transmission of an MDR strain (primary MDR). Acquisition can arise from medical error, poor TB control programs or poor patient adherence to treatment. A history of prior TB treatment remains the most important risk factor for MDR-TB 6. According to the most recent WHO estimates, 490,000 MDR-TB cases and more than 110,000 MDR-TB deaths occur annually 4. The first international MDR-TB survey demonstrated that MDR-TB was present worldwide, with ‘hot-spots’ in Russia, Latvia and the Dominican Republic 7, 8. The 2008 report, which included data until 2007, recorded the highest rates of MDR-TB ever, observed primary MDR-TB rates greater than 6% in 14 regions, and warned about extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB, resistance to rifampin, isoniazid plus resistance to any fluoroquinolone and any of the second-line anti-TB injectable drugs) in 45 countries 9.Given the dynamic interplay between HIV and TB, it is not surprising that MDR-TB has complicated the picture. HIV and MDR-TB are an even deadlier combination. More than 50% of HIV-infected MDR-TB patients in Peru died within two months of diagnosis 10 and studies with longer follow up observed death rates ranging from 72 to 89% 11. A study in the UK estimated that MDR-TB patients who are immune-compromised are nine times more likely to die than those not immune-compromised 12. In a XDR-TB outbreak in South Africa, 98% of co-infected patients died with median survival time of 16 days from XDR-TB diagnosis 13.Even though the impact of HIV infection on MDR-TB is of great public health importance, their relationship is not yet fully understood. HIV infection has been associated with MDR-TB outbreaks in institutional settings, such as hospitals and prisons 14, 15. It remains less clear whether HIV infection is also associated with MDR-TB in community settings. We aimed to summarize and critically appraise studies in order to quantify the association between MDR-TB and HIV-infection."

            "introduction": "During the early events of viral replication the RNA genome is converted into its cDNA copy which then, upon interaction with cellular and viral proteins, generates the pre-integration complex (PIC). Cellular trafficking along the microtubule network transports the PIC to the nuclear envelope. The lentivirus subfamily PICs exhibit karyophilic properties which enable them to enter the nucleus through the nuclear pore. To establish a productive infection, the viral cDNA must subsequently be integrated into the host genome by the integrase protein (IN), which is a permanent component of the virion and the PIC. IN performs several important steps in the life cycle of retroviruses. It was shown to be involved in several steps of HIV-1 replication, such as uncoating 1, reverse transcription 2, nuclear import 3, chromatin targeting 4 and integration 5. Viral components such as IN cannot perform all these functions by themselves and need to recruit host cell proteins to efficiently carry out the different activities. The molecular details and temporal sequence of these processes, and particularly the role of cellular co-factors, remain largely unknown.The IN enzyme consists of three structural and functional domains, namely the N-terminal zinc binding domain (residues 1–50), the central catalytic core domain (CCD; residues 50–212) containing the D, D, E triad that coordinates divalent ions and the C-terminal domain (residues 213–288). A systematic study of mutants in the catalytic core identified a mutation (F185K) which greatly increases its solubility 6. This mutant was used for high resolution structural studies. Several partial structures of HIV-1 IN have been solved, namely the CCD domain alone 7–10, as well as the CCD domain combined with the C-terminal domain 11 or the N-terminal domain 12 and finally, the CCD in complex with the IN binding domain of LEDGF 13. Structures of IN from other retroviruses have also been solved 14. In these structures, the catalytic core is organized into a highly conserved dimer except for the IN encoded by the Rous associated virus type-1 15, whereas the position of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains relative to the catalytic core domain is extremely variable (Fig. S1). Recently, the structures of two functional integration units have been solved, namely the crystallographic structure of the Prototype Foamy Virus (PFV) IN/DNA complex 16 and the cryo Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the HIV-1 IN/LEDGF/DNA complex 17. To validate the comparison between the two structures we solved the EM structure of the PFV IN tetramer (Fig. S2 and methods S1). The X-Ray structure of the PFV IN could be readily fitted in the envelope showing that the overall arrangement of the IN domain does not depend of the method used (EM and X-ray). Both structures showed that the functional unit is composed of an IN tetramer. The comparison of the two structures revealed a different organization of the monomers in the tetrameric unit (Fig. S3). Moreover, most of the residues showed to be important for DNA binding and/or 3′processing in the HIV-1 integrase model constructed using the PFV IN structure 18 are also in interaction with DNA in our EM model 17.Taken together, the data reveal a high flexibility in the linkers between the IN domains as well as in their oligomeric organization. This inherent flexibility explains the propensity of IN to interact with multiple partners and to intervene in numerous biological functions by exposing and reshaping interaction surfaces 19–21. The final arrangement of the domain is probably strongly dependent of the interaction with protein co-factors and IN function in the infected cell (microtubule migration, nuclear internalization, chromatin targeting and integration). Several cellular co-factors have been shown to be important for HIV-1 infection and to interact with HIV-1 IN 22–26. Among them, the INtegrase Interactor protein 1 (INI1) which is a homolog of yeast SNF5, the core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex 27, and the Lens Epithelium-Derived Growth Factor (LEDGF) 28, a transcriptional co-activator. The function of LEDGF in HIV-1 infection is to target IN to chromosomes of infected cells 29. Its expression is required for proviral integration and subsequent production of HIV-1 virions 30. At the structural level, the interaction with LEDGF was shown to produce an IN active form by maintaining a stable HIV-1 IN tetramer 17.INI1 was the first protein shown to interact with IN 27. The 385 residue long INI1, contains a C-terminal SNF5 homology domain with 3 highly conserved sequence motifs: repeat 1 and 2 and a coiled-coil motif (Fig. S4). Repeat 1 was found to be necessary and sufficient to bind to IN 31. The role of INI1 in the HIV-1 replication cycle remains controversial, but it has been clearly established that it acts both on the early and late stages of viral infection, probably by distinct mechanisms. In the late stage, INI1 may facilitate proviral transcription by enhancing Tat function 32–36. Indeed, INI1 could act as a regulating factor to initiate one of two mutually exclusive transcription programs after integration, namely post-integration latency or high-level, Tat-dependent gene expression 37. It has also been shown that over-expression of the INI1 integrase binding domain in the cell inhibits HIV-1 assembly by specifically binding to viral gag-pol protein 38. Finally, INI1 was shown to be incorporated in mature virions with a stoichiometry of 1 INI1 for 2 IN molecules 39 and to incorporate SAP18 HDAC complex into virions 40. INI1 has been shown to both increase 38, 41, 42 and inhibit 43 viral replication. In vitro experiments on reconstituted nucleosomes have demonstrated that purified SWI/SNF complexes stimulate viral DNA integration by restoring the DNA accessibility to IN via nucleosome remodeling 41.In order to clarify the INI1 - mediated inhibition and/or activation functions in the early stage of HIV-1 infection, we analyzed the structure-function relationships of a quaternary complex comprising the full length wild type HIV-1 IN, the full length wild-type LEDGF, the INI1 IN binding domain (174–289) (INI1-IBD) and viral U5 DNA. We first showed that the IN/LEDGF complex performs concerted integration more efficiently than isolated IN molecules and with a higher fidelity regarding the structure of the integrated DNA expected for HIV-1. In the presence of INI1-IBD, integration events are decreased whereas the formation of integration by-products (donor/donor and linear FSI) are strongly reduced when compared to IN alone or to the IN/LEDGF complex. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements showed that the dissociation constants of IN/LEDGF and IN/LEDGF/INI1-IBD for U5 vDNA remain in the same order of magnitude, indicating that viral DNA interaction is not impaired by the presence of INI1-IBD. Analysis of the 3′ processing activity demonstrated that INI1-IBD, when bound to the IN/LEDGF complex, inhibits the 3′ processing reaction. Mass spectrometry and FCS analysis showed that 2 INI1-IBD, 2 LEDGF and 2 U5 vDNA molecules interact tightly with an IN tetramer. Finally, the structural analysis by cryo-EM of the IN/LEDGF/DNA 17 and INLEDGF/INI1-IBD/DNA complexes revealed the binding sites of LEDGF, INI1-IBD and U5 vDNA on the IN tetramer. INI1-IBD interacts with IN on the opposite side of the LEDGF binding site and within the target DNA interaction region, locking IN in a stable constrained conformation. Taken together, our data show that INI-IBD steadies the highly flexible IN protein in a compact stable conformation. This suggests that the role of the full length INI1 in the early stage of infection could be to stabilize IN and prevents its inter-domain flexibility, thus preventing non-specific interaction and auto integration on the route to its specific nucleosome targets, while LEDGF organizes and stabilizes an active IN tetramer suitable for specific vDNA integration."

            "introduction": "The conventional method of influenza vaccine delivery is intramuscular injection of liquid formulations using syringes and needles. The use of needles may cause fear and stress in children and adults 1. Needle stick injuries and reuse of needles and syringes are additional risks associated with conventional injections. To overcome these problems, extensive research is being carried out on alternative delivery methods and delivery routes for influenza vaccines 2. Multiple delivery routes are currently being studied, including nasal, pulmonary, sublingual, oral and dermal routes. These routes usually require different delivery methods than needles; these can be sprays, dry powders or microneedles. Alternative delivery methods for the intramuscular and subcutaneous routes are limited. Examples in development are liquid jet injections and powder jet injections 3, 4.Recent outbreaks of influenza A strains such as the highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 5, the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 and more recently avian influenza A H7N9 6, 7, have increased the need for more effective vaccines. Novel influenza vaccines are required to be quickly available for mass vaccination in case of epidemics. Current influenza vaccines have limited stability, and thus require a cold-chain. This makes distribution and storage of these vaccines expensive and challenging, specifically in developing countries due to the limited cold-chain infrastructure.There are four types of marketed non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccines: whole inactivated virus (WIV), virosomal, split and subunit vaccine. These vaccines differ in terms of viral components and particulate organization 8. Subunit and virosomal vaccines contain only the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface antigens, while WIV and split vaccines also contain internal viral components such as internal proteins and, in case of WIV, viral RNA. WIV and virosomes maintain a viral particulate organization of approximately 150 nm, whereas subunit and split vaccines consist of a less organized mixture of components. These differences in characteristics have effects on vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy of the different influenza vaccines, which is important for the development of novel influenza vaccine formulations and delivery methods.Another potential alternative delivery system for influenza vaccines are bioneedles 9. Bioneedles are small hollow implants made from thermoplastic starch (for images, see Hirschberg et al 10). They are loaded with an antigen by filling the inner compartment (volume of 5 μl) with a liquid vaccine formulation followed by subsequent lyophilization. Vaccination with antigen filled bioneedles is performed by intramuscular or subcutaneous implantation under high velocity using compressed air 9. After implantation, the bioneedle dissolves, resulting in the release of the antigen. A clinical study showed that empty bioneedles are well tolerated by healthy volunteers during and after administration (unpublished data, manuscript in preparation). No local toxicity other than tissue damage from bioneedle injection was observed at the site of implantation. Previous studies with tetanus toxoid and hepatitis B vaccines have shown that antigens delivered by bioneedles induce comparable or improved immune responses in mice compared to liquid vaccines delivered by conventional injection 10, 11. Moreover, the lyophilized vaccine antigens in these bioneedles showed improved thermostability. This reduces the need for a cold-chain and allows long-term storage of vaccines. Furthermore, bioneedles are ideally suited for mass vaccinations. Vaccination with bioneedles is relatively easy, very quick and does not have the risk of needle stick injuries. Applicators (under development) will be low cost devices working on compressed air. Pressurizing the device can be done manually, which make it ideal for use in developing countries. Furthermore, cost assessments have indicated that bioneedle applicator devices could be supplied free of charge for the use in public health care in developing countries.In this current study, we compared the immunogenicity of influenza vaccine filled bioneedles with the immunogenicity of conventional liquid influenza vaccines in mice. In order to identify the most potent influenza vaccine formulation for inclusion in bioneedles, we included four types of non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine. Furthermore, the thermostability of the lyophilized influenza vaccine formulations was evaluated."

            "introduction": "Clostridium perfringens is a gram-positive bacterium prevalent in soil and in the intestinal contents of both humans and animals. The species produces numerous toxins associated with a range of illnesses including food poisoning (normally associated with C. perfringens enterotoxin, CPE), gas gangrene (associated with α-toxin), and necrotic enteritis (associated with β-toxin). Using a toxinotyping system, strains of C. perfringens are categorized into types A through E based on the production of four major lethal toxins: α, β, ε, and ι 1–3. The ε-toxin (produced by types B and D) is the most potent of these toxins and primarily affects livestock in the form of rapidly fatal enterotoxemia. Although human infections by C. perfringens type B or D strains are infrequent, evidence does suggest the ε-toxin may be toxic to humans 4–7; the toxin also has been shown to be cytotoxic to cultured human cells 8–10. Because of the potential for toxicity in humans, its extreme potency (ε-toxin exhibits an LD50 of approximately 100 ng/kg in mice) and the lack of therapeutics approved for human use, ε-toxin is categorized as a select agent by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 11, 12.Evidence indicates that ε-toxin is a pore-forming protein that causes dysregulated ion homeostasis and cell death. The toxin is hypothesized to bind to a specific receptor on the surface of host cells, localize to cholesterol-rich lipid rafts, and form a heptameric pre-pore followed by insertion of an active pore into the plasma membrane 13–15. The toxin forms an asymmetrical pore allowing the passage of molecules up to 500 Da 16; this pore is thought to disrupt ion homeostasis and ultimately to result in cell death 17, 18. Evidence suggests that ε-toxin might bind to a specific glycoprotein receptor on the host cell surface. In previous studies, binding of ε-toxin to both rat brain and mouse kidney was inhibited by proteases or treatments aimed at removing glycosylation 19, 20. Additionally, we have shown that the highly O-glycosylated membrane-protein hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 (HAVCR1) is essential for ε-toxin cytotoxicity and have demonstrated that the toxin binds to the extracellular domain of the protein 8. However, another recent study suggests that sialidase treatment can enhance toxin binding and cytotoxicity 21.The interaction between pore-forming toxins and host cells is more complex than simple toxin binding and pore-formation. Studies demonstrate that a broad range of responses are stimulated upon exposure to pore-forming toxins, including signal transduction pathways, lipid and sterol synthesis, the unfolded protein response, caspase-1 activation, and hypoxia repression pathways 22–26. These host cell responses may be protective against low doses of toxin, but the host cell responses may also contribute to cytotoxicity. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis’s Cry toxin activates a Mg2+-dependent cytotoxic event involving the stimulation of a G protein, adenylyl cyclase, and protein kinase A 27. Similarly, mitogen-activated/extracellular regulated kinase (MAP2K1, MEK1), protein kinase C (PKC), and calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) signaling pathways contribute to cell death of eukaryotic cells treated with either BcII toxin from Bunodosoma caissarum or EqTxII toxin from Actinia equine 28.Using gene trap mutagenesis in the toxin-susceptible MDCK cell line we recently identified host cell genes that appear to facilitate ε-toxin toxicity 8. These genes encode a variety of functions including a cell surface receptor (HAVCR1), transcriptional regulation (ZMYND8 and ZBTB20), and signal transduction (BCL3, DUSP5, and CCDC134). We also identified the gene encoding CAV2. CAV2 is a scaffolding protein found associated with CAV1 in cholesterol-rich flask-shaped invaginations (caveolae) in the plasma membrane which are primarily involved in cell signaling and macromolecule endocytosis. In this study, we examine the roles of CAV1 and -2 in ε-toxin-induced cytotoxicity. We demonstrate that cells deficient in CAV1 or -2 exhibit increased resistance to ε-toxin. Furthermore, we show that the toxin interacts with the caveolins, and that caveolins play a role in ε-toxin oligomerization."

            "introduction": "Although cleaning has been a common activity in an historical context, it is since the 19th century that complex mass marketed cleaning products form part of our cleaning habits 1. During the last century thousands of different cleaning products have been produced, generating phenomenal global growth in the industry 2. Advertising of cleaning products has been mostly directed at women and is supported by the idea that cleaning is synonymous with happiness 3 and health. Nonetheless, studies have identified the adverse consequences of cleaning products on human health 4 and the environment 5. Contact dermatitis 6, asthma 7 and other respiratory disorders 8, poisoning 9 and bacterial resistance 10 have been associated with the use of cleaning products. Endocrine disruption has also been associated with exposure to cleaning products 11. Adverse consequences in the environment include eutrophication 12, anatomical and physiological changes in aquatic and terrestrial fauna 13, the elicitation of estrogenic response in mammals and fish 14, the facilitation of the adsorption of pharmaceutical compounds such as acetaminophen and carbamazepine by aquifer materials and sediments 15, and the creation of water-repellent soils due to irrigation with gray water which contains surfactants 16.Nearly 12% of the global land surface is formed by carbonate rocks, prone to chemical dissolution, i.e. karstification 17. Karstic aquifers are the source of drinking water for about 25% of the world population 18, in both, developed 19 and developing countries 20. Karstic aquifers are vulnerable to contamination 21, particularly from septic tank leachate 22. In the United States, where about 20% of total households use septic tanks 23, boron 24 and phosphorus 25 derived from detergents were found in aquifers contaminated by septic waste in karstic terrain.Popular awareness of the vulnerability of fresh water resources and concerns about the role played by the detergents in water pollution and the emergence of health problems can be explored through the concepts of Environmental Awareness (EA) and Risk Perception (RP). EA is the information that people have about any phenomena related to their environment 26,27, their concern about the environment 28, and their willingness to act in favor of the environment, including the behavior derived from that commitment 29. The concept of EA has been used to analyze popular knowledge, concerns and attitudes about issues such as household electronic devices 30, water pollution 31, conservation 32 and climate change 33. The RP concept functions in the context of the evaluation of judgments about activities and technologies considered to be risky 34. RP studies have analyzed popular knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to water reuse 35, pesticides 36, loss of agro-biodiversity 37 and West Nile virus 38. When the object of the RP study is a product, RP refers to how much that people feel that their safety is threatened by using it 39. To our knowledge there are no published studies relating cleaning products, RP and EA in the developing world in general and Mexico in particular, and cleaning products contamination studies are scarce. Detergent compounds have been found in the San Juan River in the state of Nuevo León 40, in the Texcoco River in central Mexico 41 and in the Lerma–Santiago River in the state of Mexico 42. In the Yucatán Peninsula, high concentrations of phosphates associated with household and hotel sewage have been found in the coastal lagoons of Chelem in Yucatán and in Nichupte and Bojórquez in Quintana Roo 43.Mérida’s karstic surface 44 was formed during the Pliocene-Miocene epoch 45. The permeability of the karstic formation facilitates infiltration 46, increases groundwater vulnerability to pollution 47 and explains the lack surface water 48. The aquifer is the only source of fresh water in the zone and its availability in the entire state is affected by saltwater intrusion, overexploitation 49 and by contamination 50. In the urban area, water from the top 20 meters of the aquifer is not suitable for human consumption anymore 51. As Mérida lacks a conventional sewerage system 52 untreated effluents infiltrate the groundwater 53. Sewage management in Mérida relies upon septic tanks, most of which are not built to proper technical specifications 54,55 and thus hinder wastewater transformation, chemical degradation and biodegradation processes 56. The aim of this paper is to analyze the answers of 739 women in Mérida, the capital city of the state of Yucatán (Mexico), which explored their knowledge of water sources and sewage treatment in the city and the effect of environmental awareness on perceived environmental and health risks related to household cleaning products. This study supplies information to risk communicators and health and environmental authorities applicable not only in Mérida, but in every city with karstic aquifers and on-site sewage disposal systems around the world."

            "introduction": "Type I interferons (IFN) are a family of antiviral cytokines that are produced early in response to viral infection 1. RNA intermediates of viral replication are recognized by cytosolic and endosomal pattern recognition receptors (PRR), such as RIG-I-like receptors (RLR) or Toll-like receptors (TLR), which signal through adaptor molecules (e.g., MAVS, TRIF, and MyD88) and transcription factors (e.g., IRF-3 and IRF-7) to induce type I IFN expression and secretion. Type I IFNs bind to a heterodimeric receptor (IFNAR) and mediate pleiotropic effects downstream of a canonical Janus kinase (JAK)-Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway. This results in the induction of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), activation of antigen-presenting cells, and regulation of cytokine and chemokine production (reviewed in 2). Although IFNAR is expressed on all nucleated cells, individual cell types may respond differently to signaling by type I IFN, as evidenced by overlapping yet distinct transcriptional programs 3, 4.CD11c+ cells are integral members of the mammalian innate and adaptive immune response. In the mouse, CD11c is expressed highly on dendritic cell (DC) subsets (CD4+, CD8α+, and CD103+), some macrophage (MØ) populations, and on selected CD8+ T cell subsets 5–7. CD11c+ cells are professional antigen presenting cells that respond to viral infection through a number of PRR, including the RLRs. CD11c+ DCs process and present antigens, express co-stimulatory molecules, and secrete cytokines and chemokines that regulate cell migration, leukocyte recruitment, and activation of adaptive immunity 7.West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family of positive-stranded enveloped RNA viruses and causes neuroinvasive disease in humans and other vertebrate animals 8. Mosquitoes transmit WNV and in the skin CD11c+ cells and keratinocytes are believed to be initial targets of infection 9, 10. Infected DCs migrate to the draining lymph node (LN) where viral replication ensues, resulting in viremia and spread to other peripheral organs 11. Viral replication in the skin and LN induces a local and systemic type I IFN response, which is critical for limiting WNV replication and preventing dissemination to the brain and spinal cord. Indeed, subcutaneous WNV infection of Ifnar−/− mice results in a rapidly fatal infection, which is associated with high viremia and altered tissue and cellular tropism compared to wild-type (WT) mice 12, 13. Analogously, Mavs−/− mice, which lack RLR signaling, exhibit increased susceptibility to WNV infection in many tissues 14. Recent reports also have observed that the control and regulation of WNV infection requires IL-1ß production 15–17, and that inflammasome activation synergizes with type I IFN signaling to suppress WNV replication.The significance of cell type-specific responses to IFN in vivo in the context of the control of viral pathogenesis is not well understood. Prior experiments with WNV infection suggested that type I IFN signaling has distinct temporal functions in the development of adaptive immunity 18. The generation of cell type-specific conditional deletions of Ifnar has allowed its role on specific cell types to be analyzed in the context of infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic disease 19. Studies have shown an enhanced susceptibility to mouse hepatitis (MHV) and norovirus (MNoV) infection in animals with conditional Ifnar deletions, and this was associated with greater viral burden and decreased survival compared to WT animals 20–22.Here, we evaluated WNV pathogenesis in mice lacking Ifnar expression in CD11c+ cells (CD11c Cre+Ifnarf/f mice) or MØ/monocytes/granulocytes (LysM Cre+Ifnarf/f mice). Remarkably, deletion of Ifnar in either CD11c+ or MØ/monocyte/granulocyte cells resulted in severe WNV disease that essentially copied the phenotype of the complete Ifnar−/− mice. Thus, the dominant antiviral effects in vivo of type I IFN signaling against WNV occur in myeloid cell types. Analysis of WNV-infected mice revealed preferential infection of Ifnar−/− myeloid cells, and this resulted in a syndrome of “cytokine storm”, which was associated with liver and kidney damage, and rapid death. Immunopathogenesis in WNV-infected Ifnar−/− and CD11c Cre+Ifnarf/f mice animals was mitigated by exogenous administration of TNF-α blocking antibodies, and the sepsis syndrome was associated with massive alternative pathway complement activation as tissue damage was improved in mice lacking the complement components C3 or factor B. Our experiments suggest that high levels of viral replication in WNV-infected Ifnar−/− myeloid cells can trigger uncontrolled production of proinflammatory cytokines and pathological complement induction and activation, which together contribute to a sepsis-like syndrome."

            "introduction": "TB is a major fatal infectious disease. The current World Health Organization (WHO) figures estimate a worldwide TB incidence of 8.8 million per year and 1.45 million deaths annually 1. This statistic is compounded by the emergence of drug-resistant strains of TB 2, 3, 4 and co-infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 5.Timely diagnosis of active pulmonary TB cases is important for the control of the disease. Despite the enormous burden of TB, conventional approaches to diagnosis used today rely on tests that have major drawbacks. The current gold standard for diagnosing TB is smear microscopy and culture. The major drawback of sputum smear microscopy is its poor sensitivity − estimated at 50% 6, 7. The culture method is the most sensitive, however, it is more expensive than microscopy, requires up to eight weeks for the isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and requires a high standard of technical competence 8. Other methods available for diagnosing active TB include the lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigen-detection assay 9, 10 and, more recently, a fully automated polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular test called GeneXpert®. The GeneXpert® has advantages in that it is rapid and little training is required. However, the drawback is that the test is currently expensive and not a point-of-care tool. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the GeneXpert® in the South African setting was found to be suboptimal in smear-negative, HIV-infected patients 11.Accurate diagnosis of TB requires reliable biomarkers as targets of detection. Two Mtb proteins that have attracted attention as desirable targets for new TB drugs and diagnostics are CFP-10 and ESAT-6 12, 13, 14, 15. The CFP-10 protein, encoded by the Rv3874 (esxB) gene, and the ESAT-6 protein, encoded by the Rv3875 (esxA) gene, can interact in vitro to form a tight 1∶1 heterodimer 16, 17. These two proteins are potent T-cell antigens recognised by over 70% of tuberculosis patients and are thus good TB biomarkers 18, 19, 20. Moreover, CFP-10 and ESAT-6 are not present in many nontuberculous mycobacteria and in the Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine 5, 18, 19. A recent study reported on the use of antibodies to detect the two proteins in clinical specimens with a sensitivity of 81.6% and 95.4% for CFP-10 and ESAT-6, respectively, and a specificity of 92.2% and 100% for the two proteins, respectively 20. This data bodes well for a diagnostic tool that detects the antigens in clinical specimens. However, the use of antibodies as detection reagents has some limitations, which can be circumvented by aptamers.Aptamers, by virtue of their high specificity and high sensitivity, could serve as tools for the early and specific detection of active TB and meet the ASSURED (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and robust, Equipment-free, and Deliverable to the end user) diagnostic guidelines recommended by WHO for developing countries 21. The isolation of aptamers, with the capacity to recognise virtually any class of target molecule with high affinity and specificity, has been made possible by the development of the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) process 22, 23, 24. Since aptamers can be produced using chemical synthesis or by PCR, the cost of producing aptamers is 10–50 times less than those for producing antibodies 25. Aptamers have been raised against a wide variety of targets, from small human molecules and viral proteins to whole microorganisms 26.Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers are usually used for diagnostics due to the greater inherent stability of DNA and low cost of production compared to RNA aptamers. Examples include aptamers that detect thrombin, adenosine and cocaine 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. Aptamers have also been raised against (1–3)-b-D-glucans, which were the first aptamers developed for the detection of a biotoxin in environmental respiratory diseases 25. TB-specific aptamers include ssDNA aptamers against Mtb polyphosphate kinase 2 (PPK2) 32, as well as aptamers against the whole Mtb bacterium 33. Furthermore, aptamers against MPT64 were the first ones raised against Mtb 34, but this antigen lacks the sensitivity of more potent antigens like ESAT-6 and CFP-10. To date, however, aptamers have not been raised against the immuno-dominant antigens CFP-10 and ESAT-6, or the CFP-10.ESAT-6 heterodimer.The aim of this study was therefore to isolate ssDNA aptamers against the CFP-10.ESAT-6 heterodimer and test the ability of these aptamers to detect Mtb in sputum samples from patients with culture-proven tuberculosis."

            "introduction": "Retroviruses and retrotransposons are of profound importance to eukaryotic biology, evolution, and medicine. These retroelements constitute at least 40% of the mass of mammalian genomes 1 and 75% of the maize genome 2. When retroelements are transcribed they remodel eukaryotic genomes by generating a cDNA and integrating it into locations scattered throughout the host cell genome 3, 4. By doing so, retroelements have the potential to influence local gene expression or to promote recombination and generate deletion mutations 5–7. In some cases they act in trans to catalyze retrotransposition of cellular RNAs, generating pseudogenes or new exons within existing genes 8, 9. Since retrotransposon enhancer elements influence local gene expression, and retrotransposon silencing can vary from cell to cell, it has been proposed that retrotransposons contribute to the phenotypic variation that distinguishes genetically identical individuals 10. Additionally, it has been suggested that programmed release from retroelement silencing accompanies metazoan development and leads to hypermutation in complex somatic tissues like the brain 11, 12.Among retroelements, retroviruses have received much attention, in part due to their association with human disease. Basic studies concerning retroviral replication have greatly advanced understanding of the biochemistry of retrotransposition 4, 13. A tetramer of the viral integrase protein (IN) 14 cleaves the ends of the viral cDNA to produce recessed 3′OH and free CA dinucleotides at the terminus of each long terminal repeat (LTR) 15. IN catalyzes nucleophilic attack of host chromosomal DNA by the two free 3′-OH viral DNA ends, resulting in covalent attachment of the retroviral DNA strands to the host DNA 16–18. The remaining free ends of the viral DNA are then repaired by host enzymes 19–21.Study of HIV-1, the retrovirus that causes AIDS, has led to the development of drugs that block retrotransposition and alter progression to AIDS 22, 23. Attempts to develop better therapies for HIV-1 would benefit from a deeper understanding of the integration mechanism. Gene therapy vectors based on another retrovirus, MLV, dramatically rescued children from a life-threatening illness, but a large percentage of the patients suffered from insertional activation of proto-oncogenes 24–28. This lethal complication further emphasizes the need to better understand retroviral integration site selection in host chromosomal DNA.Retroviruses establish proviruses at sites throughout the host cell genome, but integration is not random. Some regions are favored hundreds of times over others 29, 30. For some retroviruses, transcribed regions are preferred 31, 32, though high-level, concurrent transcription at a given target gene inhibits integration 33. Nucleosome-bearing DNA is targeted more efficiently than free DNA in vitro 34–37 perhaps because the integration machinery preferentially targets bent DNA 38. Indeed, high-throughput sequencing experiments analyzing over 40,000 HIV-1 integration sites in cells show periodic distribution on predicted nucleosome positions, consistent with favored integration into outward-facing DNA major grooves in chromatin 39.The retrotransposition mechanism, and integration site selection on a genomic scale, differs considerably from one class of retrovirus to another. HIV-1 infects non-dividing cells 40, 41 and integrates preferentially into transcriptionally active genes, all along the length of the gene 32, 42, 43. In contrast, MLV integration requires mitosis 41, 44 and has a tendency to localize near promoters, 20% of the time within 2 kB of transcriptional start sites 31, 42. Retroviral capsid (CA) is sufficient to determine whether a given virus infects non-dividing cells 45, 46 but both CA and IN contribute to integration site selection: an HIV-1 vector in which IN-coding sequences and a fragment of gag encompassing CA were replaced by the homologous MLV sequences exhibits the retrotransposition behavior of MLV 43.Of the many host factors reported to interact with retroviral CA or IN 47–52, the lentiviral IN-interacting protein PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 53–55 is the most informative regarding integration site selection. LEDGF promotes the infectivity of HIV-1 and related lentiviruses and influences integration site selection 56–59 perhaps by acting as a physical tether directing integration to the chromosomal sites this protein naturally occupies. In support of this model, fusion of heterogeneous chromatin binding domains to the part of LEDGF that binds IN redirected the site of HIV-1 integration 60–62. The mechanism by which gammaretroviruses such as MLV preferentially target promoter regions is unknown.We attempted to identify chromatin features predictive of retroviral integration site selection by exploiting ChIPSeq datasets. Compared to previous methods, this technology has brought profiles of human DNA binding factors and histone epigenetic modifications closer to genome-wide saturation 63–68. Over 60 ChIPSeq datasets were compared with 14 retroviral integration data sets in order to develop tools for predicting viral integration sites throughout the genome with maximal predictive power."

            "introduction": "Biochemical studies performed in higher eukaryotes have shown that DNA replication initiates at specific sites, or within initiation zones, suggesting the involvement of particular DNA sequences called replicators (reviewed by DePamphilis 1999). In contrast, functional studies, as well as studies of DNA replication performed in early embryos of various vertebrates and invertebrates, have suggested that initiation of DNA replication can take place with limited sequence specificity (reviewed in Gilbert 2001).The presence of specific initiation sites and of initiation zones has also been proposed to explain the latent replication of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome in human cell lines. During latent replication, the EBV genome is maintained as a circular episome (∼175 kb in size), and the host cell provides both the replication machinery and the licensing apparatus that limit the genome's duplication to once per cell cycle (reviewed in Kieff 1996; Yates 1996). Initiation site oriP was the first initiation site identified in the EBV genome. In the presence of the viral protein EBNA1, this DNA sequence confers autonomous replication to plasmids transfected into human cell lines (Yates et al. 1984). In addition, initiation of DNA replication at oriP was recently shown to be regulated by geminin, and to correlate with the binding of various cellular components of the replication complex (Orc1, Orc2, Orc3, Orc4, Orc6, Mcm2, Mcm3, and Mcm7) (Chaudhuri et al. 2001; Dhar et al. 2001; Schepers et al. 2001; Ritzi et al. 2003). These and other reports have been interpreted as evidence that oriP contains a replicator (e.g., Koons et al. 2001). However, other initiation sites have also been described (Kirchmaier and Sugden 1998), and a study performed by two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis at neutral pH has suggested the presence of a large initiation zone (Little and Schildkraut 1995). In addition, reports from different laboratories have shown that various portions of the EBV genome, including oriP, can be deleted without affecting the maintenance of the episomes in replicating cells (see Discussion and references therein). Therefore, the presence of specific replicator sequences and their relationship with the sites of initiation of DNA replication also remain to be demonstrated in this system.We recently began to study the replication of individual EBV episomes using fluorescence microscopy (Norio and Schildkraut 2001). In a previous study, we collected various images of the Raji EBV genome (Norio and Schildkraut 2001). The analysis of those molecules demonstrated that the duplication of different EBV episomes begins at different initiation sites located within the initiation zone identified by 2D gel electrophoresis. However, the number of molecules analyzed was not sufficient to infer the precise dynamics of activation of the initiation sites (i.e., to detect events having a short life or occurring infrequently during the duplication of the episomes).In the present study, we performed an extensive analysis of the replication dynamics of the EBV genome in two human Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (Raji and Mutu I). By utilizing a different procedure to stretch DNA molecules we were able to collect a large number of images of the EBV genome representative of different stages of duplication. This allowed us to determine how DNA replication initiates, progresses, and terminates throughout the EBV genome and to precisely measure the duplication time of specific portions of the EBV genome.These improvements allowed us to obtain important new results as well as to extend previous observations. Here we show that initiation events are not limited to a specific portion of the EBV genome (namely the initiation zone detected by 2D gel electrophoresis), but, unexpectedly, take place throughout the EBV genome. Multiple initiation events were also detected in individual EBV episomes. Hence, if the initiation sites do correspond to replicators, the latter must necessarily be highly redundant (present at a frequency of one or more every 20 kb).Our new results also indicate that, in these two EBV strains, both the frequency and the order of activation of the initiation sites vary considerably throughout the viral genome. This variation involves initiation sites such as oriP, the sequence of which is highly conserved in the two EBV strains (Salamon et al. 2000). Hence, the utilization of the initiation sites is largely independent of their DNA sequence, and it is affected by the genomic context (i.e., the presence/absence of initiation sites activated earlier or the presence of transcription). Finally, we noticed that the initiation sites that tend to be activated earlier during the duplication of each episome are located in clusters, each of which spans several kilobases. The locations of these clusters are different in the Raji and Mutu I strains. Therefore, the utilization of the initiation sites (particularly their order of activation) appears to be regulated at the level of genomic regions rather than at the level of individual initiation sites."

            "introduction": "The household is a fundamental unit of transmission for many directly transmitted infections. In addition, the household provides a “laboratory” within which key measures of transmission such as infectiousness, generation time and the effect of immunity or vaccination can be studied 1. In recent years considerable effort has gone into understanding the dynamics of transmission within populations organised into households using mathematical models 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Most effort has gone into analysing the asymptotic behaviour of these models, elucidating the threshold levels of transmission required for infection to be self-sustaining, calculating final epidemic sizes, or predicting the impact of generalised or targeted interventions designed to reduce or eliminate transmission. In parallel, methods have been derived to estimate the parameters which govern transmission within the household from detailed case reports 7, 8, 9, 10. However, scant effort appears to have been paid to how to apply household structured models to the analysis of epidemics, either retrospectively or in real time.Concurrently, mathematical models have played an ever greater role in interpreting and responding to emerging pathogens. These models have typically been either of the “simple but tractable” variety which ignore or average over demographic structure and social mixing patterns 11, 12 or the “complex computer simulation” variety that capture many details of demographic structure and dynamics, but of whom the behaviour can only be determined by intensive numerical analysis 13, 14, 15. The aim of this study is to develop methods of a perhaps “slightly less simple but still tractable” variety that capture some of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important, but which can be rapidly applied (say on a daily basis) in an emerging outbreak situation, to inform policy. More specifically, the aim is to arrive at a method to estimate the key transmission and control parameters for a model of transmission within and between households from as few detailed observations as are likely to be gathered in the heat of a major outbreak.The resulting analysis will still be based on major simplifications in respect to all the spatial and other social constructs that govern disease transmission, but less so than those based on the very simplest assumption of free, homogeneous mixing. In this context, it should be stated that even in the best, most robustly parameterised microsimulations, gross approximations are made in describing the fabulously complex web of human behaviour, and even they are only attempts to characterise the statistical properties of the system as a whole. Extensive effort is, and should continue to be, spent on identifying the conditions where different types of simplification (household models, static network models, spatial metapopulation models…) can and can't be justified, and in developing analytical approximations to describe disease transmission within such simplified structures.Individual based simulations of influenza and smallpox pandemic spread and control, incorporating detailed information on population density, age structure, commuting patterns, workplace sizes and long-distance travel have highlighted the particular importance of the household as a fundamental unit of transmission 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 (and reviewed in 19). Pure household models have been used fruitfully to explore detailed policy options in a city-wide response to an influenza pandemic 20. It thus seems a priori that household models are a natural starting point in terms of extending theory previously developed for the simplest assumption of homogeneous mixing.The analysis presented here will focus on deriving new estimators for individual and household reproduction numbers, denoted R (t ) and R* (t ) respectively. The individual reproduction number R (t ) is defined roughly as the average number of people someone infected at time t can infect over their entire infectious lifespan; as I will show below, there are several ways of defining this more precisely. The household reproduction number R* (t ) is defined here as the average number of households a household infected at time t can infect 3, 6. The individual reproduction number R (t ) rightly plays a privileged role in epidemiology, as it is a meaningful measure within any contact network. However, of the possible summary measures of epidemic progress, it is not necessarily the most useful. For example, for an emerging directly transmitted pathogen, such as pandemic influenza virus, public health interventions may target the household rather than the individual, enforcing household quarantine as well as offering antivirals to the household to limit transmission within the household. In such a situation, the household reproduction number R * (t ) is more directly related to the parameters which characterize the intervention, and is thus a better measure of the effect of these interventions. These quantities (R (t ) and R * (t )) share the two essential properties of reproduction numbers, namely that they increase when infectiousness increases and decrease when infectiousness decreases (monotonicity), and that they mark a threshold that separates exponentially growing epidemics (when R (t )>1 or equivalently R * (t )>1) from exponentially declining epidemics (when R (t )<1 or equivalently R * (t )<1) 3, 6.The structure of the paper focuses first on deriving estimators for individual reproduction numbers, then on household reproduction numbers and finally on examples of pandemic influenza dynamics and measles."

            "introduction": "Three randomized controlled trials have shown that voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) reduces heterosexual HIV acquisition in men by up to 60% 1–3. On the basis of these trial results, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) now recommend that VMMC be offered to heterosexual men in combination with other effective HIV risk reduction interventions in settings with generalized HIV epidemics and where a substantial proportion of men are not circumcised 4.The long-term population-level impact of implementing and scaling up VMMC services is expected to be considerable in terms of HIV infections averted, as well as net savings associated with the reduced need for treatment, care, and support of infected individuals. Previous model-based studies estimated that VMMC scale-up in countries with generalized HIV epidemics could result in substantial reductions in HIV transmission and prevalence over time among both men and women 3,5–9. A recent review of these studies concluded that one HIV infection could be averted for every five to 15 VMMCs performed 10. Modeling studies also have found that expansion of VMMC services produces net savings when compared to lifetime HIV treatment costs 8,9,11. In addition, studies have shown VMMC to be protective against some other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in both men and women. VMMC has been found to reduce the risk of herpes simplex virus-2 in men 12 and human papillomavirus in men 12–15 and their female partners 16, and is associated with a reduction in the risk of genital ulcer disease 3,17 and genital cancers 18–20 in both men and women.In light of this evidence, in early 2007, WHO and UNAIDS identified the following priority countries for VMMC scale-up: Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Nyanza Province in Kenya (Figure 1). Four years later, most of these 13 countries have developed plans for VMMC scale-up and are at various stages of program implementation. However, with a few exceptions (e.g., Nyanza Province in Kenya and the Iringa Region in Tanzania), progress in expanding VMMC services remains slow 21.\n        10.1371/journal.pmed.1001132.g001\n        Figure 1\n        \n          Geographic distribution of HIV and male circumcision prevalence.\n          For the 13 countries included in the study, the map on the left indicates the prevalence of HIV in adults ages 15 to 49 y. The map on the right indicates the percentage of men who are circumcised.\n        \n        \n      There is consensus that VMMC scale-up will require substantial funding and massive efforts to adequately train personnel, equip facilities, and ensure the regular distribution of necessary commodities—mostly in settings with weak health systems and resource constraints. As background for the scale-up of safe VMMC, WHO, UNAIDS, and collaborating partners have developed a number of guidelines and toolkits, including a recommended minimum package of VMMC services 22 and clinical guidelines for the provision of these services 23. In addition, to facilitate a more rapid scale-up of safe VMMC, WHO has outlined considerations for models to optimize the volume and efficiency (MOVE) of VMMC services 24. Central to these considerations is the efficient use of facility space through the dedication of multiple surgical beds to one surgical team and the coordination of client flow; the efficient use of staff time through task shifting and task sharing, including deployment of non-physicians to complete all or specific steps in VMMC surgery; and the bundling of commodities and supplies required to perform VMMC, including consumable materials and surgical instruments 24.To support decision making and planning for VMMC scale-up, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Health Policy Initiative collaborated with UNAIDS to develop the Decision Makers' Program Planning Tool (DMPPT) 25. This modeling tool, which has been reviewed by an expert panel 10, allows analysts and decision makers to estimate the epidemiologic impact and cost of alternative programmatic options for scaling up VMMC.The objective of this study is to estimate the country-specific epidemiologic impact and the cost and net savings associated with scaling up VMMC services based on MOVE considerations in the 13 priority countries in eastern and southern Africa. The perspective that is taken is that of governments and their international partners in their roles as health program funders. To do this, we run country-specific DMPPT models and explore how the results for each country vary by VMMC effectiveness, VMMC coverage level, time to scale-up, level of post-circumcision behavior change, VMMC unit cost, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) cost.This study expands on previous related work 8,9,11 in several ways. All of our analyses are country-specific and based on the most recent data on HIV and male circumcision prevalence available. Our calculations provide more comprehensive estimates of VMMC-related costs than was the case in previous studies since they include costs for supply chain management and waste management, as per WHO's recent recommendations for efficient VMMC scale-up 24. In addition, we provide country-specific results on impact (VMMC per HIV infection averted), cost-effectiveness (cost per HIV infection averted) and cost savings (cost of VMMC relative to the averted cost of lifetime provision of ART)."

            "introduction": "Circulating testosterone (T) declines with advancing age 1 especially after the age of 65 years 1–3. The prevalence of T deficiency in different studies varies from 13.8% 4 to 20%–25% 5, 6 and 38.7% 3, depending on different cut-off values of serum T and different age ranges.Androgen deficiency is common among men with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), ranging from 20 to 30% according to different studies 7, 8. In the past, men with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) showed a high prevalence of hypogonadism (29%–50%), mainly caused by impaired testicular function due to both wasting syndrome and opportunistic infections 9–12. The introduction of HAART changed the spectrum and modified the prevalence of several co-morbidities, including androgen deficiency 11, which seems to occur less frequently than in the past 9, 10. Despite its frequent occurrence, the actual prevalence of T deficiency remains not well defined in HIV-infected patients, ranging from 3–7% 7, 12, 13, 14, 17 to 54–64% 15, 16 in the different reports. An impairment of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis plays a possible major role in determining T deficiency, as suggested by the common occurrence of low T in concomitance with inappropriately low or normal serum luteinizing hormone (LH) in HIV-infected patients 12, 17, 18. However, the underlying causes and mechanisms remain unknown. Previous studies on T deficiency in HIV-infected men suffer from several limitations: i) the lack of of information on gonadotropins in most studies 7, 12, 13, ii) the small number of subjects enrolled 7, 12–17, iii) the possibility of inappropriate blood sampling 7, 13–16 e.g. not considering serum T diurnal variations 19, iv) the measurement of free T alone 7, 16 by inaccurate assays 20, v) the retrospective design only from record charts 14, and, finally, vi) the lack of studies with an endocrinological rather than infectivological focus. These limitations weaken the evidence regarding T deficiency in HIV-infected men. As a result, clinical evidence resulting in the form of guidelines 21 or expert-based opinions 8, 22 is scarce.At present, clinical practice guidelines for androgen deficiency recognize that HIV-infected men could be at higher risk of low serum T and perhaps of developing overt hypogonadism and indicate that T replacement treatment may be useful as an adjunctive therapy in HIV-infected men with low serum T but only in those with concomitant weight loss 21. In subjects without HIV T deficiency is usually defined by investigating the hypothalamic pituitary-testicular axis. Accordingly, it is possible to differentiate primary hypogonadism (testicular failure) from secondary hypogonadism (gonadotropin deficiency) by measuring gonadotropin serum levels 21, 22. In addition, several factors such as obesity or a poor health status could affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in men 4, 6, 21, 22. However, a systematic evaluation of T deficiency occurring in HIV-infected patients is still lacking, and the only available data come from small subsets of patients. Given the high frequency of T deficiency in HIV-infected patients 7, 12–17, understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of hypogonadism in these men, who may be considered for androgen replacement treatment, is essential for a rational treatment.At present, two measurements of serum total T obtained in the morning (at 8 AM) documenting a T value below the lower limit of the laboratory range are required to confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism 21. The accuracy of T measurement is fairly controversial due to several limitations of the methods employed, especially those used for serum free T. Direct measurement of free T with commercially available kits is, in fact, unreliable, and the calculation of serum free T using sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and total T should be preferred 20. However, even this parameter remains of limited value in clinical practice due to the possible sum of errors of each assay 23. Measurements of free T by equilibrium dialysis and total T by tandem mass spectrometry are regarded as the gold standard in terms of accuracy and precision 20, 21, but are still expensive and time-consuming to be routinely used in clinical practice 23. For these reasons, the repeated measurement of morning serum total T remains the most practical tool in the clinic and is the approach most widely used by clinicians to rule out T deficiency in men 21, 22, 23.Considering all the factors mentioned above, we estimated the prevalence of low serum total T in a large cohort of HIV-infected men, predominately men with lipodystrophy. In particular, we evaluated T deficiency by measuring not only circulating T 21, but also serum LH in order to use the combination of T and LH to provide a comprehensive information on the gonadal axis function 4. Combining LH with serum total T improves understanding of the nature of T deficiency in the context of HIV; furthermore it may be of help in the selection of candidates for T replacement treatment and strict monitoring. Furthermore, considering the changes in body composition occurring in HIV-infected men 11, 12, 18 and the potential impact of adiposity on the gonadal axis, we investigated the relationships of serum T with body composition and parameters of HIV infection and gonadotropin secretion, with the aim of identifying possible predictive factors for low serum T."

            "introduction": "Adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4) is part of a five-member family of heterotetrameric adaptor protein (AP) complexes, AP-1 to AP-5, known for their ability to recognize sorting signals in the cytosolic domain of transmembrane proteins destined to post-Golgi compartments 1–4. AP complexes AP-1 (γ, β1, μ1, σ1), AP-2 (α, β2, μ2, σ2), and AP-3 (δ, β3, μ3, σ3) (subunit composition in parenthesis) are components of protein coats that, after signal recognition, incorporate cargo proteins from a donor compartment into clathrin coated vesicles for transfer to a different compartment 5. Less well known are AP-4 (ε, β4, μ4, σ4) and the recently discovered AP-5 (ζ, β5, μ5, σ5), but it is expected that they have similar functions in vesicular transport as their counterparts 6. The five AP complexes are broadly expressed among eukaryotes, with orthologues found in the genome of all metazoan analyzed thus far, as well as of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana 6, 7. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, on the other hand, expresses only AP-1, AP-2 and AP-3 6, 8, suggesting that AP-4 and AP-5 possess specific roles in higher eukaryotes. Some AP complexes occur as cell-specific isoforms, such as mammalian AP-1B and AP-3B found in epithelia and neurons, respectively 8. In mice, gene ablation of either of the ubiquitously expressed γ and µ1A subunit of AP-1A or the μ2 subunit of AP-2 is embryonically lethal 9. In humans, mutations in several subunits of the AP complexes result in severe genetic disorders, such as MEDNIK syndrome for AP-1 10, Hermansky-Pudlack syndrome for AP-3 11, cerebral palsy for AP-4 12, 13, and hereditary spastic paraplegia for AP-5 4, highlighting the fundamental role that AP complexes play. Each AP complex associates to a characteristic cellular membrane to perform its function. AP-2 is well regarded as cell surface-bound, where it cooperates during clathrin-mediated endocytosis 14. All of the other AP complexes are found at intracellular membranes. In the case of AP-4 it localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN; 1, 2, 15), from where it seems to participate in several sorting events, such as to the basolateral membrane in polarized epithelial cells 16, to the somatodendritic domain in neurons 17, and to early endosomes 18.The best-characterized sorting signals recognized by AP complexes are comprised of arrays of amino acids that fit one of two consensus motifs: a DEXXXLLIM signal and a tyrosine-based, YXXØ signal (where Ø is an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic side chain) 14, 19. AP-1, AP-2 and AP-3 contain a binding site for DEXXXLLIM signals that is made up of two subunits, γ and σ1 for AP-1, α and σ2 for AP-2, and δ and σ3 for AP-3 20–22, whereas YXXØ signals bind the C-terminal domain of the μ1, μ2 and μ3 subunit of the respective AP complex 23, 24. The recognition of these signals is important in the sorting of many type-I, type-II, and multispanning transmembrane proteins 19, and for a variety of cell processes, such as the downregulation of the human immunodeficiency virus coreceptor CD4 that contains a DEXXXLLIM signal 25, or the efficient endocytosis of the transferrin receptor that contains a YXXØ signal 26. The structural bases for these interactions have been elucidated by X-ray crystallography of DEXXXLLIM signals bound to AP-2 27, and of YXXØ signals bound to either μ2 28, 29 or μ3A 30. The crystallographic analyses of the μ subunits show that the C-terminal domain, containing the binding site for YXXØ signals, consists of an immunoglobulin-like fold with sixteen β-strands organized in two β-sandwich subdomains called A and B. The binding site in both μ2 and μ3A is located in subdomain A, where two hydrophobic pockets are shaped on strands β1 and β16 to accommodate the Y and Ø residues of the YXXØ signals 28, 30.In contrast to AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3, the analysis of AP-4 has shown that it is not capable of effectively binding canonical DEXXXLLIM and YXXØ signals 31, 32. The only reported canonical interactions are of the μ4 subunit of AP-4 with YXXØ signals from the lysosomal transmembrane proteins CD63, LAMP-1, and LAMP-2a 2, 31, 33. These interactions, however, are very weak, and disruption of μ4 expression does not affect the localization of these proteins to lysosomes 16, 32. A stronger and more functional interaction is one recently found between μ4 and a YXXØ-type, YXFYLFLE motif contained in the cytosolic tail of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein (APP) 18. The YXFYLFLE motif highly resembles canonical YXXØ signals, but it has unique features, and, importantly, disruption of the μ4-YXFYLFLE signal interaction produces a mislocalization of APP from early endosomes to the TGN 18. This interaction has been characterized by X-ray crystallography 18, and it differs from that of μ2 and μ3A with canonical YXXØ signals. Unexpectedly, the binding site for the YXFYLFLE signal of APP is located on subdomain A of the C-terminal domain of μ4, but at the opposite face of the predicted YXXØ binding site. The Tyr, FYL, and FL residues are fitted on distinct hydrophobic pockets formed by strands β4, β5 and β6, and amino acid substitutions in this site abolish the binding of the APP tail to μ4 18. That mutations in the predicted canonical binding site of μ4 abolish the interaction to the YXXØ signal of LAMP-2a 31, suggested the intriguing possibility that μ4 has two binding sites for structurally related tyrosine-based sorting signals. Thus, we decided to analyze in more detail the functionality of both binding sites in the recognition of the YXFYLFLE signal of APP. Here we report that although mutations in either of the tyrosine-based signal binding sites of μ4 affected its interaction to the APP cytosolic tail, only mutations at the YXFYLFLE binding site resulted in the mislocalization of APP to the TGN, indicating no functional role of the canonical site for the recognition of the APP signal."

            "introduction": "Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse), the Asian tiger mosquito, is an aggressive human- and day-biting species native to Asia that has recently expanded to at least 28 countries outside its native range, and now occurs in all inhabitable continents 1. Detailed theoretical analyses indicate that the spread of Ae. albopictus may well continue into many more regions of the world 1–3. Although this species is often considered mostly an urban nuisance, it was the principal dengue vector in Hawaii and other areas were Aedes aegypti L. populations have been controlled 4 and in the summer of 2013, an autochthonous case of dengue in Suffolk County, New York has been attributed to thriving populations of Ae. albopictus 5. Furthermore, since recent mutations in the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) increased the vector competence of Ae. albopictus for the viral agent 6, 7, chikungunya has become epidemic in Africa and the Indian Ocean Basin 8. Although chikungunya fever has not spread broadly in the temperate zone, an epidemic in northern Italy in 2007 sickened over 200 people 9 and small numbers of locally transmitted CHIKV cases were identified in southern France in 2010 10, both of which were driven by local populations of Ae. albopictus. The European expansion of CHIKV would not have been possible without the prior invasion of that continent by Ae. albopictus 11.Aedes albopictus is a container-inhabiting mosquito strongly associated with human habitats (especially outside its native range) and capable of ovipositing diapause-destined eggs that survive even in cold northern latitudes in parts of its native (e.g., northern Japan, China) and introduced (e.g., Europe and northeastern USA) ranges 12. The first line of control against Ae. albopictus is often source reduction 13, but when containers cannot be removed or emptied, larvicides are used 13. If adults become a serious nuisance, or disease outbreaks are ongoing or imminent, insecticides targeting the adults are applied 14.Unfortunately, the development and spread of insecticide resistance represents a serious threat as it can lead to a reduction of the efficacy of larvicide or adulticide-based control programs, as demonstrated in the control of the main dengue vector Ae. aegypti 15, 16. In contrast to Ae. aegypti, there have been only a few reports of insecticide resistance in Ae. albopictus worldwide 16, 17. Several studies implemented in the 1960s and summarized by Mouchet et al. 18 showed that several populations of Ae. albopictus from Southeast Asia and India were resistant to some of the insecticides used at the time for vector control (i.e., DDT, dieldrin and fenthion). A recent review by Ranson et al. 16 updated by Vontas et al. 19 summarized the levels of insecticide resistance in Ae. albopictus worldwide. It is apparent that resistance to the main families of insecticides currently or historically used for vector control across the world (i.e., DDT, organophosphates and pyrethroids) has been found in Ae. albopictus 20–25. In the USA, to our knowledge, only four studies have reported on insecticide resistance in Ae. albopictus: one population in Florida was resistant to the organophosphate malathion 26, populations in Texas and Illinois were also resistant to malathion 25, 27, and resistance to a pyrethroid (deltamethrin) was found in a population from Alabama 28.Insecticide resistance can be associated with mutations in the sequence of the target protein that induce insensitivity to the insecticide (target-site resistance), and/or to the up-regulation of detoxification enzymes (metabolic-based resistance). The main target site resistance mechanisms known in mosquitoes involve 1) amino acid substitutions in the voltage gated sodium channel that cause a resistance phenotype to pyrethroid (DDT) insecticides known as knockdown resistance (Kdr, 29 and 2) mutations in the acetylcholine esterase sequence that lead to insensitivity of this enzyme to organophosphates 30. Metabolic-based resistance involves the bio-transformation of the insecticide molecule by enzymes and is now considered a key resistance mechanism in insects 31, 32. Three large enzyme families, the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and carboxy/cholinesterases (CCEs) have been implicated in the metabolism of insecticides 32–34. So far, compared to other mosquito species of importance such as Anopheles spp., Culex spp., and Ae. aegypti, very little is known about the molecular or biochemical basis of resistance in Ae. albopictus and, in particular, to our knowledge, no studies have specifically examined the underlying mechanisms of resistance in USA Ae. albopictus.The objective of the present study was to determine the insecticide resistance status of Ae. albopictus across the full latitudinal range of the species in the USA. Specifically, we examined populations from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Florida (Table 1). We chose eleven chemicals that represent the main classes of insecticides historically or currently used for mosquito control (Table 2), including some that have only recently been adopted. We compared the levels of resistance of field-collected specimens to a susceptible strain of Ae. albopictus that we characterized for this purpose (reference strain ATM95). In addition, we used biochemical and molecular assays to identify putative resistance mechanisms in Ae. albopictus such as target-site mutations and up-regulation of detoxifying enzymes.10.1371/journal.pone.0101992.t001Table 1\nDetailed description with geographic and socio-economic information of the sources of mosquito populations.\n\n\n\n\nState\nCounty\nMunicipality\nMosquito population name abbreviations\nCoordinates\nAltitude\nHuman density inhabitants/Km2\n\n\n\n\nNew Jersey\nBergen\nElmwood Park\nNJBer\n40°54′N74°70′W\n14 m\n2,829\n\n\n\nMercer\nTrenton\nNJMer1\n40°13′N74°45′W\n15 m\n4,286\n\n\n\n\nEwing\nNJMer2\n40°15′N74°47′W\n38 m\n906\n\n\n\nMonmouth\nMiddletown\nNJMon1\n40°24′N74°04′W\n30 m\n626\n\n\n\n\nBelmar\nNJMon2\n40°10′N74°01′W\n4 m\n2,140\n\n\nPennsylvania\nYork\nYork\nPA\n39°57′N76°43′W\n121 m\n3,061\n\n\nFlorida\nSt John's\nSt Augustine south\nFL1\n29°50′N81°18′W\n7 m\n1,118\n\n\n\n\nSt Augustine Beach\nFL2\n29°53′N81°18′W\n0 m\n936\n\n\n\nPopulation name abbreviations are used throughout the text.10.1371/journal.pone.0101992.t002Table 2\nName, class, and mode of action of all insecticides tested in this study.\n\n\n\n\nStatus\nInsecticide\nFamily\nMode of action\n\n\n\n\nLarvicide\nBti\nBiolarvicide\nCell membrane destruction\n\n\n\nSpinosad\nNaturalyte\nNicotinic acetylcholine receptor\n\n\n\nTemephos\nOrganophosphate\nAcetylcholinesterase inhibitor\n\n\n\nPropoxur\nCarbamate\n\n\n\n\nMethoprene\nInsect Growth Regulator\nJuvenile hormone mimics\n\n\n\nPyriproxyfen\n\n\n\n\nAdulticide\nMalathion\nOrganophosphate\nAcetylcholinesterase inhibitor\n\n\n\nDDT\nOrganochlorine\nSodium channel modulator\n\n\n\nDeltamethrin\nPyrethroid\n\n\n\n\nPrallethrin\n\n\n\n\n\nPhenothrin\n\n\n\n\n\n"

            "introduction": "Since the discovery of toll-like receptors (TLRs), we have come to appreciate their crucial role in the induction of adaptive immunity against pathogens. In response to microbes, the engagement of pathogen associated molecular patterns by TLRs initiates a complex process of antigen presenting cell (APC) maturation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production 1, 2. These intricately coordinated cellular processes are instrumental to the functional differentiation of pathogen-specific T cells. Although it is suggested that stimulation via different TLRs is sufficient to promote distinct immune responses, very little is known about how this program is set by mature DCs. This issue is particularly difficult to dissect in vivo, since it's not possible to directly compare stepwise events that occur upon bacterial versus viral infections.Previous studies have shown that the maturation of DCs is a key event that promotes autoimmunity in a variety of models 3, 4, 5. Evidence indicates that, TLR3 and TLR7 stimulation are critical for the activation and recruitment of autoreactive CD8+ T cells and subsequent destruction of pancreatic islet β cells 6. Activation of APCs via TLR4 or TLR9 can also disrupt self-tolerance and result in the induction of EAE 7. Likewise, TLR3, TLR4 and TLR9 appear to play a critical role in the development of autoimmune myocarditis 8, 9. While infection is a well recognized trigger of autoimmunity, recent studies suggest that endogenous TLR ligands expand TLR signaling capacity and may therefore play a role in autoimmune disorders including those arising from sterile inflammation 10.Stimulation of different PRR has the potential to induce a particular cocktail of pro-inflammatory cytokines. A given cytokine milieu may then direct the initiation of distinct adaptive immune responses. Hirschfeld et al. along with subsequent studies shed light on the cytokine specificity of TLR2 and TLR4 and its impact on T helper cell differentiation 11, 12. Following TLR4 engagement by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), murine macrophages produce large amounts of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-12 and IP-10 which selectively induced a Th1 response. In contrast, peptidoglycan (PGN) engagement of TLR2 induces moderate production of TNFα and IL-1β, without IL-12 and IP-10, biasing toward a Th2 response 11, 12, 13.Evidence suggests that differential adaptor engagement and downstream signaling by different TLRs can contribute to the production of a given cytokine milieu. For instance, TLR3 and TLR4 can signal via TRIF and activate IRF3 dependent production of IFNβ 14, 15. TLR sensors of nucleic acids, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9, have the ability of producing both IFNα and IFNβ via IRF3 and IRF7 activation 15, 16. In addition to differential adaptor engagement and downstream signaling, qualitative parameters of the TLR ligand interaction itself may contribute to the induction of certain cytokines, as in the case of TLR9 signaling where distinct endosomal trafficking of A type but not B type CpG result in IRF-7 and IFNα production 17, 18.One key cytokine that is produced upon DC maturation is the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 19. IL-12, a heterodimeric cytokine consisting of the IL-12p35 and IL-12p40 subunits, is readily produced by stimuli such as double stranded RNA, LPS, flagellin, single stranded RNA and bacterial DNA 20. Although evidence suggests that IL-12 plays an important role and has been referred to as signal 3, after the TCR induced signal 1 and costimulatory signal 2 21. The role of IL-12 in the induction of adaptive immune responses remain controversial 22. In addition to playing a significant role in the induction of Th1 responses, IL-12 also the functional maturation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) by augmenting proliferation, survival and generation of effector molecules such as perforin and granzymes 23. Studies have also identified IL-12's role in modulating lymphocyte trafficking by modulating P-SGL1 expression 24.Given IL-12's involvement in promoting multiple facets of T cell immunity, it is believed to be a key mediator of autoimmunity and has been widely used as a marker for DC activation in cancer immunotherapy 25, 26. Indeed, studies in several murine experimental models and clinical settings also point to IL-12 playing an important role in the development organ specific autoimmunity. Analysis in autoimmune prone murine strains demonstrated that predisposition to autoimmunity may be attributed to enhanced IL-12 production by APCs due to alterations in the induction of NF-κB 27, 28. In an autoimmune myocarditis model, IL-12 facilitates the differentiation of pathogenic CD8 T cell effectors 29. In the non-obese diabetic (NOD) model, the administration of IL-12 or ablation of IL-12 mediated Stat4 signaling can markedly accelerate or completely prevent the onset of diabetes respectively 30, 31. Furthermore, blocking IL-12 in patients with active Crohn disease, which is commonly associated with increased production of IL-12 by APCs, can induce stable remission 32.IL-12's impact on the development of organ specific autoimmunity is however not decidedly pathogenic across all experimental settings. In some models, IL-12 appears non-pathogenic or even protective 33, 34. Complicating the interpretation of these data is the discovery of the anti-inflammatory effects of closely related cytokine IL-35, which has redundant usage of the IL-12p35 subunit 35. One potential contributing factor to IL-12's divergent role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders may be related to the different molecular mechanisms that are necessary to initiate different autoimmune diseases. It is possible that in certain models of autoimmunity, the induction of disease depends on certain cytokines induced by different PRR ligands.The current study investigated whether different APC maturation stimuli influenced the requirement for IL-12 in the induction of a CD8 T cell mediated autoimmune response in vivo. In this report, we used the previously characterized RIP-gp transgenic model, where the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein (LCMV-GP) is expressed in the pancreatic islet β cells 36. In this model, T cells specific for the LCMV-GP remain ignorant towards the LCMV-GP expressed in the pancreas under the steady state. Upon activation, these autoreactive CD8+ T cells infiltrate the pancreatic islets and mediate the destruction of the GP+ β-cells, resulting in diabetes. Recent work has shown an alternate way to activate endogenous GP-specific T cells using mature bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). We have compared the ability of Poly I∶C and LPS to mature DCs since TLR3 acts via the adapter TRIF, while TLR4 uses both TRIF and MyD88. By maturing WT or IL-12 deficient BMDCs with Poly I∶C or LPS and pulsing mature DCs with GP peptides, the impact of TLR3 or TLR4 stimuli on the requirement for IL-12 in breaking tolerance and inducing autoimmunity can be evaluated. Unexpectedly our studies showed that autoimmunity induced with Poly I∶C matured DCs is IL-12 independent, whereas IL-12 was essential for the induction of autoimmunity using LPS matured DCs. Our analysis also showed that Poly I∶C stimulated DCs produce high amounts of IFNα, compared with LPS stimulated DCs. Accordingly, IFNα given together with LPS stimulated DCs was able to induce autoimmunity in the absence of IL-12. Therefore, IFNα can overcome the requirement for IL-12 in the induction of T cell mediated pathology elicited by LPS-matured DCs. These studies clearly demonstrate that different TLR matured DCs require different cytokines to elicit a functional immunopathological adaptive immune response. These observations have important implications for controlling tissue specific autoimmunity and anti-tumor immunity."

            "introduction": "HIV-1 integrase (IN) is an important therapeutic target as its function is essential for viral replication. A tetramer of IN assembles on the viral DNA ends to form the stable synaptic complex (SSC) and catalyzes two reactions necessary for the integration of linear viral DNA into the host chromatin 1. IN initially removes a GT dinucleotide from the 3′-terminus of each viral DNA end (3′-processing), and then integrates recessed viral DNA ends into the target DNA in a staggered fashion through concerted transesterification reactions (DNA strand transfer). IN is comprised of three domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) which contains the Zn-binding motif (HH-CC type), the catalytic core domain (CCD) which contains the DDE catalytic triad that coordinates essential Mg2+ ions, and the C-terminal domain (CTD) which contains an SH3-like fold (reviewed in 2). Each of these domains contributes to protein multimerization 3–6.In infected cells, IN assembles with a number of viral and cellular proteins to form a larger nucleoprotein complex termed the preintegration complex (PIC). Cellular chromatin associated protein LEDGF/p75 is a key binding partner of HIV-1 IN and promotes effective tethering of PICs to active genes during integration 7–13. The C-terminal domain of LEDGF/p75, termed the Integrase Binding Domain (IBD), stabilizes the IN tetramer by engaging the IN CCD dimer interface and the NTD of another dimer 13–16. The N-terminal portion of LEDGF/p75, which contains a PWWP domain, nuclear localization signal, AT hooks and highly charged regions, associates with chromatin through engaging both nucleosomal DNA and the trimethylated H3 tail (H3K36me3) 17–19, which is an epigenetic marker for active genes and positively correlates with HIV-1 integration sites 20.The catalytic function of HIV-1 IN has been exploited as a therapeutic target. Three HIV-1 IN inhibitors, raltegravir (RAL), elvitegravir (EVG) and dolutegravir (DTG), are currently in clinical use 21, 22. These inhibitors bind at the enzyme active site and inhibit DNA strand transfer (termed IN strand transfer inhibitors or INSTIs). HIV-1 IN mutations that alter amino-acids near the INSTI binding site can confer resistance to first generation INSTIs RAL and EVG, and have emerged in patients receiving treatment 23–25. Second generation INSTI DTG retains significant activity against many RAL and EVG resistance mutations and appears to have a higher genetic barrier to resistance. However, IN mutations that confer low-level resistance to DTG have been recently reported 26. Thus the development of small molecules that impair IN function with different mechanisms of action while retaining potency against INSTI resistant viruses is an important goal.One such mechanism is to target IN multimerization. We have reported studies demonstrating a highly dynamic nature of HIV-1 IN subunit-subunit interactions and that such flexibility is important for the assembly of the SSC 16, 27. Various ligands that bind at the IN CCD dimer interface can bridge interacting IN subunits and promote aberrant IN multimerization 28–31. The term “aberrant IN multimerization” is used here to refer to the formation of catalytically inactive IN oligomers that differ from the correctly assembled catalytically active tetramer found in the SSC. A significant advantage of stabilizing rather than destabilizing interacting subunits is that small molecule inhibitors do not have to overcome the energy barriers associated with the formation of large protein-protein interfaces. In proof-of-concept studies 30 a small molecule inhibited IN activity in vitro by binding at the IN CCD dimer interface, stabilizing the interacting subunits and promoting aberrant IN multimerization.Recently, quinoline-based allosteric IN inhibitors (referred to here as ALLINIs) have been reported that target the clinically unexploited LEDGF/p75 binding site at the IN CCD dimer interface and potently inhibit HIV-1 replication in cell culture 32–38. An ALLINI carboxylic acid hydrogen bonds with one IN subunit, potentially mimicing an interaction with LEDGF/p75. The quinoline-ring, another key structural feature of ALLINIs, engages another subunit of IN through hydrophobic interactions 32, 33, 35. The initial report 32 suggested that these compounds selectively impair the IN-LEDGF/p75 interaction. However, follow up studies 33–35, 38 have demonstrated that the quinoline-based ALLINIs inhibit both IN-LEDGF/p75 binding and LEDGF/p75-independent activities with similar IC50 values in vitro. The underlying mechanism for inhibiting the catalytic function of IN has been shown to be promoting aberrant IN multimerization 33–35. This multimodal mechanism of action of ALLINIs concordantly resulted in cooperative inhibition of HIV-1 replication in cell culture 33, 38. Selection of viral strains emerging under ALLINI pressure revealed changes near the inhibitor binding site on IN. In particular, A128T substitution is most common and has been shown to confer marked resistance to the majority of ALLINIs 32, 35, 39, 40.Studies on the antiviral mechanism of action of ALLINIs have unexpectedly revealed that these compounds inhibit both early and late stages of HIV-1 replication 32–38, 41, 42. In fact, different ALLINIs were 3- to 40-fold more potent when added to producer cells versus target cells 41, 42. In target cells ALLINIs did not affect reverse transcription but did impair HIV-1 integration. The treatment of producer cells with ALLINIs resulted in virions with conical cores that were devoid of electron dense material, likely corresponding to ribonucleic acid-protein complexes (RNPs). Strikingly, RNPs were mislocalized between the core and viral membrane 38, 41, 42. The viral particles produced in the presence of ALLINIs entered target cells normally but were defective for subsequent reverse transcription in target cells. A single substitution in HIV-1 IN at the inhibitor binding site which confers resistance to quinoline-based ALLINIs was able to overcome these late stage affects 38, 40, 41. Furthermore, ΔIN viruses transcomplemented with wild type Vpr-IN were fully susceptible to ALLINI inhibition, whereas Vpr-IN containing a substitution in IN at the inhibitor binding pocket exhibited marked resistance 38. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that ALLINIs target IN during the late stages of HIV-1 replication and compromise the assembly of electron dense cores. However, dissecting the exact mechanism of action of the quinoline-based ALLINIs has been complicated because they both inhibit IN-LEDGF/p75 binding and promote aberrant IN multimerization with similar potency in vitro 33–35.Here we report design of small molecules that allowed us to probe the role of HIV-1 IN multimerization independently from IN-LEDGF/p75 interactions. We named these selective multimeric IN inhibitors or MINIs. For this, we have exploited the available X-ray crystal structures of quinoline-based ALLINIs bound to the HIV-1 IN CCD dimer to modify the existing scaffold. In particular, we have altered the quinoline moiety and made a series of modifications to enhance potency specifically for modulating IN multimerization without significantly affecting IN-LEDGF/p75 binding. These studies have resulted in a new class of pyridine-based MINIs, which potently modulate IN multimerization but are not effective inhibitors of IN-LEDGF/p75 binding. Using these new compounds as investigational probes we have delineated the significance of ordered IN structure for the formation of correctly assembled virus particles. Furthermore, MINIs inhibited the HIV-1 variant with the A128T IN substitution, which confers resistance to the majority of ALLINIs. These findings indicate the feasibility of our rational modification approaches to improving IN inhibitors and present a novel class of multimerization selective IN inhibitors as investigational probes."

            "introduction": "Invasive species are a global problem in natural, agricultural, and human health systems, and there is a corresponding great need for optimized strategies for detection of invasive species movement 1. For human pathogens, it may be possible to integrate standard records collected in clinics in an analysis of spatial spread. For many invasive species, however, time-consuming field surveys performed by trained personnel are needed to track invasions. Despite the cost, information about invasive spread is critical for managers at many levels, from policy makers to individual land managers. The trend toward large research networks, such as the US National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), is another motivation for identifying optimal approaches to sampling across large linked ecological systems 2. Sampling strategies and strategies for identifying points for management of invasive species will often have significant overlap. The spatial structure of landscapes to be sampled is an important consideration in constructing ecological sampling designs and measures of invasion 3, 4. Taking into account the dispersal mechanisms of invasive species in combination with the connectivity of the landscape for invasion has the potential to improve management efforts 5, 6. For example, particular natural or artificial water bodies may function as invasion hubs, so that management of invasives in those lakes may have greater impact 7, 8. Human transport hubs may also have important roles in invasions 9 and models of vaccination programs in human and other animal populations may often be relevant to invasions in plant landscapes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.The rapid development of network modeling approaches promises new insights into spatial and temporal components of biological invasions. In typical applications of network models to spatial processes, locations or individuals are ‘nodes’ and the probability of encounters or movement between any two nodes is described by the weight of the ‘link’ that joins the two nodes. Network model applications in biology have included movement of animals among habitat patches and movement of pathogens through a host population 15. The connectivity of a network plays an important role in determining the dynamics of epidemics 16.Recently, network models have been explored for a range of plant epidemics 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. For example, Margosian et al. 24 considered a network of US counties, with links between adjacent counties weighted as a function of crop densities, and analyzed the connectivity of the landscape based on different threshold density levels. However, this model was limited to identifying more and less strongly connected regions and did not directly predict the course of an invasion process. Balcan et al. 25 is an example of national and global scale modeling of human epidemics based on human movement, but there is a need for a network modeling platform for large-scale landscapes outside human transportation networks.The prediction of the progress of an epidemic can be mathematically represented using many different models. In SEIR models, individuals in the population are categorized as Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), or Recovered (R). Depending on the selected subset of possible compartments, SI, SIR, SEIR, or SIS models can be considered, which can be appropriate for different infectious processes. A set of differential equations can be written to represent the change in the fraction of the population in each compartment over time. In a SIR model, the existence of a threshold for the aggressiveness of the infection above which a major outbreak will occur was proved by Kermack and McKendric in 1927 26. When the population is not very large, deterministic models are not accurate enough, so probabilistic models were proposed where a set of differential equations can be written to represent the change in the probability that a single node is in a given compartment. For some probabilistic models, an epidemic threshold can be defined 27. When the homogeneity assumption is not realistic, a further refinement can be obtained by the use of the concept of a contact network; a given node is only in contact with the subset of nodes to which it is linked. Using a network to represent the contacts among nodes, model predictions can become more accurate at the expense of increased complexity. Furthermore, depending on the scale of the representation of the population, nodes can represent not only individuals but also groups of individuals. In the latter case the models are called meta-population schemes and include information about the movements of subpopulations between nodes.A network is characterized by an adjacency matrix (a matrix of link weights or indicators for the presence or absence of a link between two nodes) and by features such as the node degree (the number of links connected to a given node), shortest path (the shortest distance between any given pair of nodes), and the diameter (the longest shortest path). For all the network-based models, the topology of the network plays a key role in determining the characteristics of the spreading process 28. Considering for example scale free networks, networks where the degree distribution follows a power law, Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani 29, 30 proved the absence of the epidemic threshold. In other words, all the infections can cause epidemics in infinite scale free networks, and for this reason such networks are very vulnerable. Conversely, regular networks, with almost constant node degree, and networks with a large diameter show robustness with respect to virus spread 31. For general networks, Van Mieghem et al. 32 and Wang et al. 33 proved that the epidemic threshold is proportional to the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. The model proposed by Wang et al. 33, and further extended by Schumm et al. 34 to weighted networks, serves as the basis for our model development below.The structure of network models uses information about the status of individual nodes in an explicit way, suggesting their potential for analysis of sampling strategies. Strategies for identifying nodes in epidemic networks that are particularly important for vaccination efforts have been the subject of several studies (e.g., 10, 11, 12, 13, 14). And in the context of computer network analyses, strategies for sampling the most important links have been evaluated (e.g., 35). However, strategies for sampling invasive species in the resource-intensive context we have discussed here represent additional challenges 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45. In this study, we present what is, to our knowledge, the first continental-scale test of the utility of network metrics for optimizing sampling strategies under limited resources, based on one of the most extensive data sets for an invasive species. The soybean sentinel plot network has been held up as an example of what can be accomplished in integrated national research programs such as the US National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) 46. The sentinel plot dataset is also an important resource for evaluating optimal sampling approaches for use in programs such as NEON.Our first objective was to develop a dynamic network model for soybean rust in the USA, using the sentinel plot dataset and local information about host availability and wind speed and direction. We went a step beyond the model of Margosian et al. 24, by estimating parameters to describe the probability of movement between county nodes based on a subset of the sentinel plot dataset and by validating the model using another subset. Unlike the models of Balcan et al. 25, our model was based on probabilities of invasive species dispersal outside human transportation networks. Our second objective was to use this model to evaluate a set of strategies for sampling invasive movement under increasing limits on sampling resources. Beginning with the complete sentinel plot network, we evaluated the error in predictions when a smaller subset of the sentinel plots was retained following each of the following four strategies: (i) random selection of the subset, (ii) weighted probability of inclusion based on geographic zone, (iii) selection of the subset based on historical frequency of infection, and (iv) selection based on frequency of infection weighted by node strength (where the node strength of a given node is the sum of all link weights linked to that node, so that higher node strength indicates a node that is more ‘connected’).One of the most intensely studied invasions has been that of soybean rust in the USA, an invasion of interest for several reasons. First, this invasive pathogen, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, is of great economic importance to soybean production. The disease had already caused great losses in other countries 47. For example, in Brazil huge losses were reported in 2003 48. P. pachyrhizi can also infect over 95 other leguminous species 49, so its impact on native legumes is yet to be fully appreciated. Second, the ecology of the pathogen in the US allows for the study of ‘replicate’ invasions. The disease overwinters in the southeastern US, where the weed kudzu acts as a reservoir, and migrates annually to the north by windblown spores 50. Third, the data set assembled by the impressive team studying soybean rust is one of the most substantial available for the study of invasive species. Significant efforts in modeling of soybean rust began about two decades ago 51 and the disease was detected in the continental United States in 2004 52. A network of hundreds of sentinel plots was organized by soybean researchers and organizations 53, as discussed in more detail below. An integrated aerobiological modeling system (IAMS) was developed to use the sentinel plot data for predicting progress of soybean rust, as described in Isard et al. 54, 55, 56. For soybean rust, a critical decision for farmers is whether and when to apply a fungicide. If a fungicide is applied too early or in areas that will not be reached by the pathogen, the fungicide is wasted; if fungicide is not applied when needed, soybean yields will be substantially reduced 57. Estimates of savings to U.S. soybean growers that have resulted from the extensive monitoring system in combination with the IAMS vary greatly 53, 57 and include a conservative calculation of ca. $200 million per year 58."

            "introduction": "\n        General Background\n        Since the discovery of the human monoclonal antibody CR6261 published by Throsby et al (1, PLoS ONE 2008), the isolation of an impressively wide spectrum of antibodies and therefore a family of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was made possible, e.g. F10 (2, Sui et al, Nat Struct Mol Biol, 2009), CR8020 (3 Ekiert et al, Science 2011), FI6 (4, Corti et al, Science 2011). It was determined that (a) CR6261 and F10 may neutralize all group 1 influenza viruses, (b) CR8020 may neutralize all group 2 influenza viruses, and (c) FI6 is the unique mAb to neutralize both group 1 and group 2 influenza A viruses. The discovery of mAbs is the prime mover in the development of new vaccines and antibody-based therapies. For example, an exploration of improved universal vaccines for all influenza A viruses based on CR6261-like antibodies was proposed in the papers by Wei et al (5, Science 2010) and Nabel et al (6, Nature 2010). Also, Friesen et al evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the CR6261 antibody against a lethal challenge due to the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus in ferrets (7, PLoS ONE 2010). They further provided the insight that the use of CR6261 in combination with an effective drug (i.e., Oseltamivir or Zanamivir) could become an antibody-based therapy against all influenza A viruses. These studies have defined a new paradigm in the research on vaccines and provided a useful starting point for the design of new vaccines.\n        Although a universal mAb FI6 has already been found, the insight for the use of a drug in a complex with CR6261 to neutralize all influenza A viruses is still worth pursuing, because it can provide a general method to enhance a wide spectrum of mAb and enable them to become a universal antibody. This can also show the way to enhance a universal mAb and avoid drug resistance. Therefore, this approach may lead to multiple choices for antibody-based therapies. The use of mAb in a combination with a drug will be easier and cheaper relative to the cocktail method that is based on two types of mAbs. Therefore, one of the objectives of this study is to provide a new insight regarding the utilization of mAbs. With an increasing number of mAbs becoming available, selectivity of mAbs in combination with drugs offers an opportunity to construct better mAb-drug combinations.\n        In this paper, we first determine the molecular mechanism by which Oseltamivir and Zanamivir improve the therapeutic efficacy of an mAb. Then, we look for the drugs which enhance CR6261, F10 or CR8020 to become a universal mAb, respectively. To perform the latter task, we must first deal with the hard problem of demonstrating the relationship between mAbs and the trimer HAs while being fully aware of the fact that mAbs cannot neutralize influenza viruses. For example, since we know that CR6261 cannot neutralize all group 2 influenza viruses, we should show that CR6261 and group 2 HAs may be combined first.\n        The fact that Oseltamivir or Zanamivir in complex with CR6261 improves the therapeutic efficacy of CR6261 to treat group 1 influenza viruses is a crucial piece of evidence in support of the assumption that Oseltamivir must directly act on either 3 gbn or 3 gbm. In fact, we cannot use the cocktail idea to explain this enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of CR6261 by adding Oseltamivir. This is because Oseltamivir is ineffective against H5N1 when it binds to the NA protein of H5N1 and Oseltamivir does not bind to the trimer HA alone. Therefore, the complexed protein (CR6261 with the trimer H5 HA) must be the molecular target for the action of Oseltamivir. For the same reason, we know that the CR6261-trimer HA (for all group 1 HAs) must be the target protein for both Oseltamivir and Zanamivir. In order to uncover the mechanism by which a drug may improve the therapeutic efficacy of CR6261, we should look for a clue from the complex CR6261-trimer HA for all group 1 HAs. The result that Oseltamivir may improve the therapeutic efficacy of CR6261 in treatment of H5N1 should also lead to additional clues. For example, the docking poses between the drug and its benchmark pockets are known to be very diverse.\n        Other clues and additional information will be gradually extracted. For example, based on CR8020, we find that the footprint of mAb containing an epitope is not a necessary condition for mAb to neutralize influenza viruses. This clue leads us to focus on the issue of affinity. However, it is clear that an antibody is ineffective if its footprint is located on the head of a trimer HA. To look for underlying clues, one should use both computational tools and experimental methods. Since this is not an experimental project, we will use computational modeling to the greatest extent possible.\n        Based on all clues deduced from the well-known complexes of mAbs and HAs, we determine a general molecular mechanism to explain why a drug may improve the therapeutic efficacy of CR6261, CR8020, F10 and FI6. In order to look for a drug used in combination with CR6261, F10 or CR8020 to enable it to become a universal mAb, or enhance the effect of FI6 to prevent drug resistance, we need additional insights. They can be used to show that CR6261 and F10 bind to group 2 HAs and to predict the location of the footprints of CR6261 (F10) on H3 HA.\n      \n        Tools and Materials Used\n        First, we use computational methods, namely protein-protein docking algorithms to show that CR6261 also bind to group 2 HAs. Clearly, it would be ideal if all spatial structures of group 2 HAs were well known. However, only 3D structures of H3 HA and H7 HA are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). This small number of structures is obviously insufficient. Fortunately, the conservation of footprints of antibodies on each of the group 2 HAs ensures that we may be able to infer a general conclusion based on some representative cases.\n        The available crystal structures of HAs in a complex with an antibody are 3 gbn (the H1 HA in complex with CR6261, 8), 3 gbm (the H5 HA in complex with CR6261, 8), 3 sdy (the H3 HA in complex with CR8020, 3), 3 fku (the H5 HA in complex with F10, 2), 3 ztj (the H3 HA in complex with FI6, 4) and 3 ztn (the H1 HA in complex with FI6, 4). These six crystal structures form the dataset representing prior knowledge giving us insights, which will be used to uncover the molecular mechanism of action. For example, based on 3 gbn and 3 gbm, we find that the footprints of CR6261 on H1 and H5 are the same. Based on 3 ztn and 3 ztj, we find that the footprints of CR6261 on H1 and H3 are not the same. Based on 3 fuk and 3 gbm, or 3 sdy and 3 ztj, we find that the footprints of CR6261, F10 and FI6 or CR8020 and F10 on the same HAs are different. In particular, the footprint of CR8020 challenges the notion that a footprint must contain an epitope including a fusion peptide and an αA helix.\n        The conservation of a footprint helps us find the common conserved area on the surface of a stem of group 1 HAs or group 2 HAs. This conserved area is larger than the union of the footprints from a wide spectrum of mAbs on group 1 HAs or group 2 HAs. For this purpose, we need to use multiple sequence alignment algorithms and the benchmark dataset of all available HA sequences. Since public algorithms 9–17 do not work well for large-size datasets, we have decided to use a new multiple sequence alignment algorithm MCABMSA (introduced in Section 4 of Information S1). Using MCABMSA, we have generated a dendrogram of H1–H16 and the consensus sequences of H1–H16. According to the five-group method used in ref. 2, we carry out a conservation analysis of residues in a site-by-site fashion. As a result, we have been able to construct the conserved area on the surface of group 1 HAs and group 2 HAs, respectively.\n        In order to look for the binding pocket of Oseltamivir/Zanamivir on the target protein 3 gbn, we use AutoDock 18–22. It is a good tool for finding the binding pocket of a drug on a given target protein. We have no reason to doubt the quality of AutoDock. However, having performed large-scale validation exercises, we noticed that AutoDock has a tendency to be trapped in local energy minima. As a consequence, it appears that AutoDock often sends ligands to the same area where all input drugs arrive at their minimum free energy locations. Our large-scale validation is shown in Section 1 of Information S1. This specific property encourages us to utilize this software to search for a binding pocket using a panel of drugs. For different cases studied, we have assembled different panels of drugs. In general, the panel of drugs used should have a balanced distribution with an appropriate rate between positive and negative controls. In this paper, the panel of nine drugs used consists of Amantadine, Azithromycin, Aspirin, HEM, Heroin, Isosorbide, Oseltamivir, Zanamivir, and Vancomycin. Details regarding the choice of the panel of drugs are given in Section 2 of Information S1. How to explore the binding pocket on a given target protein based on a panel of drugs is stated in Section 1 of Information S1.\n        Although CR6261 was validated experimentally to neutralize group 1 influenza A viruses, its molecular mechanism of action has not been uncovered yet. To determine the mechanism, we analyze all 3D structures of the HA-CR6261 complex for all group 1 HAs. This is because we can use it to obtain a critical affinity for CR6261 neutralizing group 1 influenza viruses. Nevertheless, we have only used 3 gbn with 3 gbm, which are partial crystal structures of HA-CR6261 complexes for H1 HA and H5 HA, respectively. As additional support, we have used all crystal structures 3 gbn, 3 gbm, 3 fuk, 3 sdy, 3 ztn and 3 ztj as a test panel to estimate the critical affinity for an mAb neutralizing the influenza viruses. Then, we have used the Ligand Explorer software and the molecular dynamic simulation (MD) software (e.g., GROMACS) to estimate the upper bound of the binding free energy for an antibody to unbind from an HA. As an introduction to MD simulations, we refer the reader to ref. 23.\n        As approximate models of the crystal structure of CR6261 or F10 in complex with H3 HA, we use the predicted 3D structures. For this purpose, we need to use the protein-protein docking software (RosettaDock). As an introduction to the topic of protein-protein docking, we recommend refs. 24–26.\n        Before we discuss the results obtained, we need to explain the benchmark dataset in more detail. We first downloaded all sequences of influenza A viruses from the Uniprot database updated on Dec.6, 2010. We then retrieved all HA sequences. All A-type sequences were classified into 16 types, denoted by H1, H2, etc., up to H16. To avoid confusion, we simply denoted C-type HA sequences and B-type sequences as HC and HB, respectively. The total number of HA sequences in the benchmark dataset is 36,051 (some sequences of a mixed or unidentified type have not been deleted from this dataset) and we have used these 36,051 sequences as the benchmark dataset in this paper. Section 3 of Information S1 shows how to obtain this dataset in detail.\n        Since we have used the unpublished multiple sequence alignment software MCABMSA, it is worth explaining the reason for it. Numerous software packages are readily available for use, for example, BLAT 9, AVID 10, MUSCLE 11, COFFEE 12, SAGA 13, MAVID 14, MSAID 15, Mauve 16 and MAFFT 17. However, the first 8 algorithms are slow and do not work well for datasets with 5,000 sequences or more. Comparably, MAFFT is very fast, but it also does not work well for datasets with 10,000 sequences or more. In the benchmark dataset, the number of sequences of H1 or H3 is equal or larger than 10,000. Therefore, we have decided to use the novel multiple sequence alignment software MCABMSA, whose full name is “Multiple Compressed and Anchor-Based Multiple Sequence Alignment for the Sequences of Viruses”. It involves four parameters: (1) the length of an anchor point, (2) the number of wrong letters that are tolerated, (3) the maximum relaxed number, and (4) the coverage rate of anchor points. A brief description of the function of each parameter and the advantage of MCABMSA is provided in Section 4 of Information S1.\n      "
